N2  - Nanosized bioprobes that can highlight diseased tissue can be powerful diagnostic tools. However, a major unmet need is a tool with adequate adhesive properties and contrast-to-dose ratio. To this end, this study demonstrates that targeted superparamagnetic nanoprobes engineered to present a worm-like shape and hydrophilic packaging enhance both adhesion efficiency to target substrates and magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity. These nanoprobes were prepared by the controlled self-assembly of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) into worm-like superstructures using glycogen-like amphiphilic hyperbranched polyglycerols functionalized with peptides capable of binding to defective vasculature. The resulting worm-like SPION clusters presented binding affinity to the target substrate 10-fold higher than that of spherical ones and T2 molar MR relaxivity 3.5-fold higher than that of conventional, single SPIONs. The design principles discovered for these nanoprobes should be applicable to a range of other diseases where improved diagnostics are needed.

N2  - In 1969, Emil Wolf proposed diffraction tomography using coherent holographic imaging to extract 3D information from transparent, inhomogeneous objects. In the same era, the Wolf equations were first used to describe the propagation correlations associated with partially coherent fields. Combining these two concepts, we present Wolf phase tomography (WPT), which is a method for performing diffraction tomography using partially coherent fields. WPT reconstruction works directly in the space–time domain, without the need for Fourier transformation, and decouples the refractive index (RI) distribution from the thickness of the sample. We demonstrate the WPT principle using the data acquired by a quantitative-phase-imaging method that upgrades an existing phase-contrast microscope by introducing controlled phase shifts between the incident and scattered fields. The illumination field in WPT is partially spatially coherent (emerging from a ring-shaped pupil function) and of low temporal coherence (white light), and as such, it is well suited for the Wolf equations. From three intensity measurements corresponding to different phase-contrast frames, the 3D RI distribution is obtained immediately by computing the Laplacian and second time derivative of the measured complex correlation function. We validate WPT with measurements of standard samples (microbeads), spermatozoa, and live neural cultures. The high throughput and simplicity of this method enables the study of 3D, dynamic events in living cells across the entire multiwell plate, with an RI sensitivity on the order of 10−5.

N2  - White light diffraction microscopy (wDPM) is a quantitative phase imaging method that benefits from both temporal and spatial phase sensitivity, granted, respectively, by the common-path geometry and white light illumination. However, like all off-axis quantitative phase imaging methods, wDPM is characterized by a reduced space-bandwidth product compared to phase shifting approaches. This happens essentially because the ultimate resolution of the image is governed by the period of the interferogram and not just the diffraction limit. As a result, off-axis techniques generates single-shot, i.e., high time-bandwidth, phase measurements, at the expense of either spatial resolution or field of view. Here, we show that combining phase-shifting and off-axis, the original space-bandwidth is preserved. Specifically, we developed phase-shifting diffraction phase microscopy with white light, in which we measure and combine two phase shifted interferograms. Due to the white light illumination, the phase images are characterized by low spatial noise, i.e., <1nm pathlength. We illustrate the operation of the instrument with test samples, blood cells, and unlabeled prostate tissue biopsy.

N2  - Biological fouling damages both human health and industry by causing infection, corrosion, structural failure, and drag on marine ships. Current efforts to clean bio-fouled surfaces by externally applying intensive mechanical energy often result in relapsed cell growth. Therefore, this study examines the extent that cell-structure interactions are orchestrated by vibration frequency, voltage-induced energy input mode, and surface energy to clean bio-fouled surfaces. This study was conducted with a tough polyacrylamide gel-coated polypropylene substrate attached to a flexible dielectric actuator that can vibrate when an oscillatory voltage is applied. We found that the maximum biofilm removal occurs by vibrating the gel-coated surface at the structural resonance frequency using a square wave input voltage. In addition, tuning the surface energy of the substrate was necessary for biofilm removal by decreasing the bacterial adhesive force. The findings from this study can be broadly applicable to assembling various advanced anti-fouling medical and industrial devices.

N2  - Investigation of the dielectric properties of cell membranes plays an important role in understanding the biological activities that sustain cellular life and realize cellular functionalities. Herein, the variable dielectric polarization characteristics of cell membranes are reported. In controlling the dielectric polarization of a cell using dielectrophoresis force spectroscopy, different cellular crossover frequencies were observed by modulating both the direction and sweep rate of the frequency. The crossover frequencies were used for the extraction of the variable capacitance, which is involved in the dielectric polarization across the cell membranes. In addition, this variable phenomenon was investigated by examining cells whose membranes were cholesterol-depleted with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which verified a strong correlation between the variable dielectric polarization characteristics and membrane composition changes. This study presented the dielectric polarization properties in live cells' membranes that can be modified by the regulation of external stimuli and provided a powerful platform to explore cellular membrane dielectric polarization.

N2  - Field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors allow label-free detection of biomolecules by measuring their intrinsic charges. The detection limit of these sensors is determined by the Debye screening of the charges from counter ions in solutions. Here, we use FETs with a deformed monolayer graphene channel for the detection of nucleic acids. These devices with even millimeter scale channels show an ultra-high sensitivity detection in buffer and human serum sample down to 600 zM and 20 aM, respectively, which are ∼18 and ∼600 nucleic acid molecules. Computational simulations reveal that the nanoscale deformations can form ‘electrical hot spots’ in the sensing channel which reduce the charge screening at the concave regions. Moreover, the deformed graphene could exhibit a band-gap, allowing an exponential change in the source-drain current from small numbers of charges. Collectively, these phenomena allow for ultrasensitive electronic biomolecular detection in millimeter scale structures.

N2  - There has been increasing demand for transparent and mechanically durable electrical conductors for their uses in wearable electronic devices. It is common to layer metallic nanowires on transparent but stiff poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) or stretchable but opaque Ecoflex-based substrates. Here, we hypothesized that layering metallic nanowires on a stretchable and hygroscopic gel would allow us to assemble a transparent, stretchable, and durable conductor. The hygroscopic property of the gel was attained by partially replacing water in the preformed polyacrylamide hydrogel with glycerol. The resulting gel, denoted as a glycerogel, could remain hydrated for over 6 months in air by taking up water molecules from the air. The glycerogel was tailored to be stretchable up to 8 times its original length by tuning the amount of the cross-linker and acrylamide. The resulting glycerogel allowed for deposition of wavy silver nanowires using the prestrain method up to 400% prestrain, without causing kinks and interfacial cracks often found with nanowires layered onto PDMS. With a prestrain of 100%, the resulting nanowire-gel conductor exhibited optical transparency (85%) and electrical conductivity (17.1 ohm/sq) even after 5000 cycles of deformation. The results of this study would broadly be useful to improve the performance of the next generation of flexible electronic devices.

N2  - Recent analysis demonstrates that the HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeat (HIV LTR) promoter exhibits a range of possible transcriptional burst sizes and frequencies for any mean-expression level. However, these results have also been interpreted as demonstrating that cell-to-cell expression variability (noise) and mean are uncorrelated, a significant deviation from previous results. Here, we re-examine the available mRNA and protein abundance data for the HIV LTR and find that noise in mRNA and protein expression scales inversely with the mean along analytically predicted transcriptional burst-size manifolds. We then experimentally perturb transcriptional activity to test a prediction of the multiple burst-size model: that increasing burst frequency will cause mRNA noise to decrease along given burst-size lines as mRNA levels increase. The data show that mRNA and protein noise decrease as mean expression increases, supporting the canonical inverse correlation between noise and mean.
AB  - Recent analysis demonstrates that the HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeat (HIV LTR) promoter exhibits a range of possible transcriptional burst sizes and frequencies for any mean-expression level. However, these results have also been interpreted as demonstrating that cell-to-cell expression variability (noise) and mean are uncorrelated, a significant deviation from previous results. Here, we re-examine the available mRNA and protein abundance data for the HIV LTR and find that noise in mRNA and protein expression scales inversely with the mean along analytically predicted transcriptional burst-size manifolds. We then experimentally perturb transcriptional activity to test a prediction of the multiple burst-size model: that increasing burst frequency will cause mRNA noise to decrease along given burst-size lines as mRNA levels increase. The data show that mRNA and protein noise decrease as mean expression increases, supporting the canonical inverse correlation between noise and mean.

Recently, a number of experiments have shown how to use these building blocks to create filament-based artificial muscles that use the conversion of writhe to extension or contraction, exposing the connection between topology, geometry, and mechanics. Here, we combine numerical simulations of soft elastic filaments that account for geometric nonlinearities and self-contact to map out the basic structures underlying artificial muscle fibers in a phase diagram that is a function of the extension and twist density. We then use ideas from computational topology to track the interconversion of link, twist, and writhe in these geometrically complex physical structures to explain the physical principles underlying artificial muscle fibers and provide guidelines for their design.

This realization is at the heart of the classical Kirchhoff-Love theory [1,2] , which considers inextensible, unshearable filaments and has spawned substantial literature [3,4] . When such filaments are twisted strongly, they deform into plectonemic structures that consist of self-braided segments and which have been observed across scales, from DNA to metal wires [5,6] . The transition between the straight and plectonemic structures in inextensible filaments has been explored extensively in both a deterministic and a stochastic setting [7–10] and continues to be a topic of interest. However, filaments made of soft elastomeric materials are also easily extensible and shearable, and their study is interesting for a range of applications such as biological tissue mechanics, soft robotics, etc [11] . Among the simplest behaviors that harnesses these modes of deformation is the controlled transition between straight filaments and tightly coiled helical shapes (solenoids) originally observed in textiles [12] , quantified experimentally in elastomers [13] , and then rediscovered in the context of heat-driven artificial muscles [14] . These energy-harvesting devices rely on the conversion of twist and bend into extension [15–17] , as solenoids untwist and stretch. Here we consider the interplay between topology, geometry, and mechanics in strongly stretched and twisted filaments and their functional consequences. We describe a filament by a centerline position vector  x ¯ ( s , t ) ∈ R 3 (  s ∈ [ 0 , L 0 ] is the material coordinate of the rod of rest length  L 0 at time  t ), while the orientation of its cross section is defined by an initially orthonormal triad associated with the director vectors    d ¯ i ( s , t ) , i = 1 , 2, 3, where    d ¯ 3 ( s , t ) is normal to the material cross section of the filament. Then, the transformation of the body-fixed frame (quantities without overbar) to the lab-fixed frame (quantities with overbar) can be written in terms of the rotation matrix  Q ( s , t ) = {   d ¯ 1 ,   d ¯ 2 ,   d ¯ 3  } - 1 [see Fig.  1(a) ]. 1 10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.208003.f1 FIG. 1. Geometry and topology of soft extensible filaments. (a) The filament centerline   x ¯ ( s , t ) and local orthogonal frame  {   d ¯ 1 ,   d ¯ 2 ,   d ¯ 3 } . Shear and extension are defined by the vector  σ = Q   x ¯ s -  d 3 , while curvature and twist are defined by the vector  k = vec (  Q ′  Q T ) . (b) Writhe (Wr) equals the centerline’s average oriented self-crossing number computed in terms of the integral of the solid angle  d Ω determined by the infinitesimal centerline segments   x ¯ (  s 1 ) and   x ¯ (  s 2 ) (left-handed intersections are negative). (c) Twist (Tw) is the integral of the infinitesimal rotations  d φ of the auxiliary curve   a ¯ around    x ¯ s . Here, the vector   a ¯ traced out by    d ¯ 1 ⊥ (i.e., the projection of    d ¯ 1 onto the normal-binormal plane) is shown in red while the curve associated with  -   d ¯ 1 is shown in yellow (see Fig.  2 ). For a closed curve  Lk = Tw + Wr , where Lk (link) is the average oriented crossing number of   x ¯ ( s ) with   a ¯ ( s ) .  In general, the centerline tangent   ∂ s  x ¯ =   x ¯ s does not point along the normal to the cross section    d ¯ 3 ( s , t ) . The deviation between these vectors characterizes local extension and shear  σ = Q (   x ¯ s -   d ¯ 3 ) = Q   x ¯ s -  d 3 [Fig.  1(a) ] and is the basis of the Cosserat rod theory [3] that allows us to include all six modes of deformation at every cross section [mathematically, this is associated with the dynamics on the full Euclidean group SE(3)]. The restriction to the Kirchhoff theory corresponds to the case  σ = 0 ; i.e., the normal to the cross section is also the tangent to the centerline, with    x ¯ s -  d 3 = 0 . Since many soft materials are close to being incompressible (i.e., the shear modulus is much smaller than the bulk modulus), filaments made of such materials will also be incompressible. Then, if  e = |   x ¯ s | is the local elongation factor and  A is the local cross-sectional area,  A e is constant locally. Accounting for this nonlinear constraint along with a simple materially linear constitutive law provides is a reasonable approximation to both neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin materials (see Ref.  [18] and the Supplemental Material [19] for model validation and more details about the physical model and numerical scheme, and Refs.  [25–27] for alternative approaches). Then, we may write the linear and angular momentum balance equations as [3,4,18]   ρ A ·  ∂ t 2  x ¯ =  ∂ s (   Q T S σ e ) + e  f ¯  ρ I e ·  ∂ t ω =  ∂ s (  B k  e 3 ) +  k × B k  e 3 + ( Q    x ¯ s e × S σ ) + ( ρ I ·  ω e ) × ω +  ρ I ω  e 2 ·  ∂ t e + e c , where  ρ is the material density,   ω ¯ = vec (  ∂ t  Q T Q ) is the local angular velocity,   k ¯ = vec (  ∂ s  Q T Q ) is the local strain vector (of curvatures and twist),  S is the matrix of shearing and extensional rigidities,  B is the matrix of bending and twisting rigidities, and  f ,  c are the body force density and external couple density (see the Supplemental Material [19] or Ref.  [18] for details). To follow the geometrically nonlinear deformations of the filament described by the equations above, we employ a recent simulation framework [18] , wherein the filament is discretized in to a set of  n + 1 vertices  {   x ¯ i  } i = 0 n connected by edges    e ¯ i =   x ¯ i + 1 -   x ¯ i , and a set of  n frames  {  Q i  } i = 0 n - 1 . The resulting discretized system of equations is integrated using an overdamped second-order scheme, reducing the dynamical simulation to a quasistatic process, while accounting for self-contact forces, internal viscous forces, and the dynamic modification of the filament geometry and stiffness (see Supplemental Material [19] and Ref.  [18] for details) while ignoring friction. To track the knotlike structures that form when the stretched and twisted filament can contact itself, we take advantage of the Calugareanu-Fuller-White theorem [28,29] :  Lk = Tw + Wr . Here, link is the oriented crossing number (or Gauss linking integral) of the centerline and auxiliary curve   a ¯ ( s ) (Fig.  1 ) averaged over all projection directions [30] , writhe is the link of the centerline with itself [31] , and twist denotes the local rotation of the auxiliary curve about the centerline tangent. In a discrete setting, we compute writhe, link, and twist of the filament modeled as an open ribbon following Ref.  [32] , as illustrated in Fig.  1 (see the Supplemental Material [19] for details). When inextensible filaments are stretched and twisted, a range of localized and self-contacting structures arise and have been well studied in both a deterministic and stochastic setting [9,10,33–36] . For highly stretched and twisted filaments, the phase space of possibilities is much richer, and in particular, a new morphological phase associated with tightly coiled helices (solenoids) appears [12,13] . To characterize these morphologies, we simulate twisting a filament clamped at one end and prestretched by a constant axial load. We first use an axial load  ∼ 25 times the critical compressive buckling force of a corresponding inextensible filament  F C = ( π 2 E I ) / L 0 2 . In Fig.  2(a) , denoting by  a the filament rest configuration radius, we show that when a critical dimensionless twist density  Φ a is reached, the filament becomes unstable to bending, leading to the formation of a plectoneme, converting twist to writhe. As the twist is increased further, occasionally the plectoneme can partially untie itself by slipping a loop over an end point, allowing the link to escape the system (see Fig. S3 in the Supplemental Material [19] ). In Fig.  2(b) , we repeat the simulation but quadruple the stretching strain and see that at a critical value of  Φ a , the filament again becomes unstable to bending but now leads to a qualitatively different equilibrium configuration: a tightly coiled helical solenoid. We note that substantial prestretch is the crucial prerequisite for solenoid formation, while shearing is found to be unimportant (see Supplemental Material [19] for details). While both plectonemes and solenoids convert twist to writhe in steps, they are otherwise quite different. Plectonemes lead to braids made of oppositely chiral helices, while solenoids lead to a single compact helix. Furthermore, a plectoneme loop converts much more twist to writhe than a solenoid does as it coils up (Fig.  2 ). However, the tightly coiled nature of the solenoidal coil makes it more stable under stretching. 2 10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.208003.f2 FIG. 2. Variation of the link, twist, and writhe as a function of the dimensionless twist density  Φ a (  a is the filament radius in the rest configuration). (a) To replicate the experimental observations in Ref.  [13] , we use a constant vertical load  F ≈ 25 F C to produce a plectoneme (  F C = π 2 E I / L 0 2 is the buckling force for an inextensible rod; see Video S1 in the Supplemental Material [19] and Ref.  [37] ). (b) We repeat the simulation with  F ≈ 90  F C , stretching the filament to deformed length  L ≈ 1.16 L 0 . Increased stretching leads to an overall similar conversion of twist to writhe leading to tightly packed solenoidal structures (see Video S2 and the Supplemental Material [19] for plots of filament energy). Simulation settings (see Supplemental Material [19] ): length  L 0 = 1     m ,  a = 0.025 L 0 , Young’s modulus  E = 1     MPa , shear modulus  G = 2 E / 3 ,  S = diag ( 4 G A / 3 , 4 G A / 3 , E A )     N ,  B =  diag ( E  I 1 , E  I 2 , G  I 3 )     N    m 2 .  We now turn to explain the experimental observations and morphological phase diagram that span the twist density-extensional strain  ( Φ a ) - ( L / L 0 ) phase space [13] (  L is the stretched filament length). Using randomly sampled twist densities and extensions in this phase space, we classify each resulting configuration on the spectrum from plectoneme to solenoid using the average relative alignment of tangent vectors at filament segments which are adjoining in absolute coordinates but separated in material coordinates, i.e.,   avg i = 1 n [ sgn (   e ¯ i ·   e ¯ k ) ] , where  k = argmin ( |   x ¯ k -   x ¯ i | ) subject to  | k - i | > ( 5 n a /  L 0 ) and  |   x ¯ k -   x ¯ i | ( 2 + ε ) a , with  ε = 0.2 (empirically determined to maximize classification accuracy). Plectoneme loops involve two strands entwined in antiparallel directions (  alignment → - 1 ), while segments of adjacent solenoid loops tend to lie parallel (  alignment → 1 ), and straight segments do not contribute to the average. In Fig.  3 we show four qualitatively different filament configurations: rectilinear, plectoneme, solenoid, and a mixed state with features of both plectonemes and solenoids. Indeed, the distinction between solenoid and plectoneme becomes blurred near the triple point. These simulations agree qualitatively with experimental observations [13] , as illustrated in Fig.  3 ; the small quantitative discrepancy between experiments and simulations is likely due to our neglect of friction. It is worth pointing out that the region of solenoid-plectoneme coexistence can be expanded by having an active agent (for example, a DNA-binding enzyme) capable of either relaxing the internal axial tension and/or inducing excess twist in the filament locally. This allows for the formation of a plectoneme in the compressed segment, after which, upon further twisting, a solenoid forms below the lifted point (Supplemental Material [19] and Fig. S9), with similarities to loop formation in chromosomes [38–40] . 3 10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.208003.f3 FIG. 3. Morphological phase space. We simulate a filament prestretched to  L / L 0 by a constant axial load and twisted by an angle  Φ a , as in Fig.  2 . By computing centerline relative alignment in neighboring loops, we find four phases: straight, plectoneme, solenoid, and plectoneme-solenoid combinations. Plectoneme alignment  ≈ - 1 , solenoid alignment  ≈ 1 , and transition configuration alignments approach 0 (dark green). For  L / L 0 ≳ 1.1 , solenoids are preferred. We expect  Φ critical to scale linearly with  L / L 0 at high extension, in agreement with this plot. Our results agree qualitatively with experiments [13] (shown in black dots; see Supplemental Material [19] for details). Hollow symbols denote plectoneme transitions, while solid points denote solenoid transitions; different shapes correspond to different filament parameters (Supplemental Material [19] ). Simulation settings (Supplemental Material [19] ):  L 0 = 1     m ,  a = 0.025 L 0 ,  E = 1     MPa ,  G = 2 E / 3 ,  S = diag ( 4 G A / 3 , 4 G A / 3 , E A )     N ,  B =  diag ( E  I 1 , E  I 2 , G  I 3 )     N    m 2 .  Our results also explain earlier observations [12] that describe straight-plectoneme-solenoid transitions in terms of varying twist density and correspond to tracing horizontal and diagonal paths through the present extension-twist density phase diagram (see Supplemental Material [19] ). Indeed, horizontally exiting the solenoid region in Fig.  3 to the right, by gradually displacing the lower solenoid end point away from the top leads to a steplike solenoid loss process. We track the required force and resulting change in writhe [Fig.  4(a) ]. The solenoid remains mostly coiled, resisting stretching with a linear-force-displacement relation, until a critical displacement at which it uncoils by one pitch and the process starts again. This stepwise uncoiling stems from a kinematic competition similar to solenoid formation: stretching the filament increases the energy required to maintain a constant number of coils. The simulated sawtooth-force-displacement pattern agrees qualitatively with experiments [13] . 4 10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.208003.f4 FIG. 4. Actuation of fiber-based artificial muscles that use the straight-solenoid transition. (a) Passive extension via solenoid loss. We displace the unclamped end    x ¯ n of a solenoid formed as in Fig.  3 with a load  ≈ 99  F C a distance  Δ U in the direction    x ¯ n -   x ¯ 0 and plot force on    x ¯ n qualitatively reproducing experiments [13] (inset; see Video S13 in the Supplemental Material [19] ). Simulation settings (Supplemental Material):  L 0 = 1     m ,  a = 0.025 L 0 ,  E = 1     MPa ,  G = 2 E / 3 ,  S = diag ( 4 G A / 3 , 4 G A / 3 , E A )     N ,  B = diag ( E  I 1 , E  I 2 , G  I 3 )     N    m 2 . (b) Active work done by changing the temperature, which effectively increases filament rigidity, here simply modeled by increasing the Young’s modulus  E of the material. This leads to the formation of a solenoidal loop in a stretched twisted filament as in Fig.  3 with a load  ≈ 116   F C as  E 0 increases gradually from 1 MPa, showing displacement  Δ U of    x ¯ n and increase in writhe  Δ Wr from initial coil writhe, reproducing experiments [14] (inset; see Video S3 in the Supplemental Material [19] ). (c) Contraction of twisted and coiled nylon polymer muscle formed by inserting twist and annealing into a helix. Filament radius doubles from initial radius  a 0 = 0.01     m , while twist decreases to keep  a k 3 constant. Numerical slope and onset of self-contact (shown as a point) agree closely with experimental results [14] (see Supplemental Material [19] for details). Beyond self-contact, radial growth pushes adjacent loops farther apart leading to helix elongation. Note that  Δ Tw + Δ Wr < 0 in the inset. Indeed, link escapes from the free boundary due to revolution of the free filament end point around the helix axis, reducing the number of loops in the helix (see Supplemental Material [19] Fig. S7 and Videos S4 and S5). Simulation settings (Supplemental Material [19] ):  L 0 = 1     m ,  a = 0.025 L 0 ,  E = 30     GPa ,  G = 2 E / 3 ,  S = diag ( 4 G A / 3 , 4 G A / 3 , E A )     N ,  B = diag ( E  I 1 , E  I 2 , G  I 3 )     N    m 2 . Note that pitch  P ,  α = 100 , number of loops, and helix radius determine  L 0 .  Finally, we use our results to quantitatively explain a series of recent experiments on twisted-fiber-based artificial muscles [14,41–43] that exploit the connection between twist, writhe, and link. The fundamental mechanism in each of these studies is associated with the formation of solenoids that this leads to an increase in writhe, causing the filament to shorten and do work against external loads. In the twisted-fiber-based artificial muscles, the externally induced twist is replaced by the use of a scalar field, temperature, that drives variations in the radius and stiffness of a pretwisted filament and causes it to untwist, producing an increase in writhe. In Fig.  4(b) , we simulate this in a minimal setting by showing the effects of (temperature-induced) increase in the elastic modulus of a prestretched, twisted, and loaded filament. To increase writhe, the solenoidal state progressively invades the straight state, lifting its lower end point toward the clamped end, qualitatively reproducing experimental observations of the linear actuator [14] . The sheath-run artificial muscles [41] work similarly by relying on the conversion of untwist to writhe, while the strain-programmable artificial muscles [42] generate a tensile stroke via temperature-induced differential expansion in a bilayer that is tantamount to changing the natural curvature of a filament dynamically. Finally, the torsional actuator [43] generates torque by inserting twist into a filament and then quickly lowering the filament’s intrinsic twist until it vanishes. Rather than replicate all the different variants of the fiber-based artificial muscles, here we limit ourselves to just two simple cases: the linear actuator [14] and the rotary or torsional actuator [43] . To capture the mechanics of the linear actuator, we initialize a filament with intrinsic twist and numerically anneal the filament into a uniform coil with space between adjacent loops, replicating the plastic deformation process by which twisted and coiled polymer muscles are formed. The fibers used in Ref.  [14] expand radially and contract axially when heated; however, as noted quantitatively in Ref.  [44] , considering radial growth with fixed fiber length is sufficient. While our model applies to an isotropic filament, we can simulate anisotropic expansion-driven untwist by following the mechanical analogy in Ref.  [14] . Imagine winding an inextensible string around a fiber, attaching it on both fiber ends. To keep the length of the string constant, the fiber would have to untwist to expand. Mathematically, this requires  a k 3 to stay constant. Hence, we prescribe a radial growth rate and continuously update the intrinsic twist   k ^ 3 to keep  a  k ^ 3 constant [45] . For a homochiral coil, the resulting untwist leads to contraction (Fig.  4 ), but in a heterochiral coil, untwisting leads to elongation (Supplemental Material [19] Fig. S8 and Videos S6 and S7). In Fig.  4(c) , we show the change in Wr and contraction for a simulated coil with initial nonzero twist density. The coils contract at the same scaled rate as experiments until adjacent loops come into contact (see Supplemental Material [19] for details of varying  P / a 0 ). To capture the mechanics of the rotary actuator [43] , we initialize the filament with intrinsic twist which is then rapidly decreased to mimic the effect of annealing via heating leading to rotary motion (see Supplemental Material [19] Sec. S7, Video S14). Altogether, our study links topology, geometry, and mechanics to explain the complex morphology of soft, strongly stretched, twisted filaments, Additionally, we showed how twist, link and writhe can be interconverted via either external loads or temperature variations, thus allowing us to quantify recent experiments on artificial muscle fibers, setting the stage for the study of complex braided, knotted, and twisted filament configurations in a range of new settings.

The filament twisting strain is defined by   k 3 -   k ^ 3 , so the filament deforms to try to make   k 3 =   k ^ 3 . After the onset of self-contact, radial growth pushes adjacent loops apart, lowering filament writhe and thereby forcing the filament to retwist despite an ever-increasing intrinsic twist.

N2  - Soft elastic filaments that can be stretched, bent, and twisted exhibit a range of topologically and geometrically complex morphologies. Recently, a number of experiments have shown how to use these building blocks to create filament-based artificial muscles that use the conversion of writhe to extension or contraction, exposing the connection between topology, geometry, and mechanics. Here, we combine numerical simulations of soft elastic filaments that account for geometric nonlinearities and self-contact to map out the basic structures underlying artificial muscle fibers in a phase diagram that is a function of the extension and twist density. We then use ideas from computational topology to track the interconversion of link, twist, and writhe in these geometrically complex physical structures to explain the physical principles underlying artificial muscle fibers and provide guidelines for their design.

N2  - Characterization of spermatozoon viability is a common test in treating infertility. Recently, it has been shown that label-free, phase-sensitive imaging can provide a valuable alternative for this type of assay. We employ spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) to perform high-accuracy single-cell phase imaging and decouple the average thickness and refractive index information for the population. This procedure was enabled by quantitative-phase imaging cells on media of two different refractive indices and using a numerical tool to remove the curvature from the cell tails. This way, we achieved ensemble averaging of topography and refractometry of 100 cells in each of the two groups. The results show that the thickness profile of the cell tail goes down to 150 nm and the refractive index can reach values of 1.6 close to the head.

N2  - Metallic nanoparticles are widely used in various applications, and their successful uses depend on the size and stability. In this study, we present a method to synthesize platinum nanoparticle clusters with tunable size and spatial organization. These nanoparticle clusters were synthesized by conducting sol-gel polymerization of platinum precursors in aqueous solution of poly(amino acid)s' derivative substituted with both particle precursor-binding amine groups and particle-binding thiol groups. Control experiments displayed that poly(amino acid)s' derivative tuned the morphology of nanoparticles and also induced organized association between the particles. Therefore, this study serves to provide novel method to synthesize a wide array of nanoparticles and clusters along with novel polymers to tune morphology and organization of the nanoparticles.

N2  - We propose an intrinsic cancer marker in fixed tissue biopsy slides, which is based on the local spatial autocorrelation length obtained from quantitative phase images. The spatial autocorrelation length in a small region of the tissue phase image is sensitive to the nanoscale cellular morphological alterations and can hence inform on carcinogenesis. Therefore, this metric can potentially be used as an intrinsic cancer marker in histopathology. Typically, these correlation length maps are calculated by computing two-dimensional Fourier transforms over image subregions - requiring long computational times. We propose a more time-efficient method of computing the correlation map and demonstrate its value for diagnosis of benign and malignant breast tissues. Our methodology is based on highly sensitive quantitative phase imaging data obtained by spatial light interference microscopy.

N2  - Two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures are promising candidates for nanoelectronics. However, the quality of material interfaces often limits the performance of electronic devices made from atomically thick 2D materials and heterostructures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip-based cleaning is a reliable technique to remove interface contaminants and flatten heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate AFM tipbased cleaning applied to hBN-encapsulated monolayer MoS2 transistors, which results in electrical performance improvements of the devices. To investigate the impact of cleaning on device performance, we compared the characteristics of as-transferred heterostructures and transistors before and after tip-based cleaning using photoluminescence (PL) and electronic measurements. The PL linewidth of monolayer MoS2 decreased from 84 meV before cleaning to 71 meV after cleaning. The extrinsic mobility of monolayer MoS2 fieldeffect transistors increased from 21 cm2/Vs before cleaning to 38 cm2/Vs after cleaning. Using the results from AFM topography, photoluminescence, and back-gated field-effect measurements, we infer that tip-based cleaning enhances the mobility of hBNencapsulated monolayer MoS2 by reducing interface disorder. Finally, we fabricate a MoS2 field-effect transistor (FET) from a tipcleaned heterostructure and achieved a device mobility of 73 cm2/Vs. The results of this work could be used to improve the electrical performance of heterostructure devices and other types of mechanically assembled van der Waals heterostructures.

N2  - Understanding deformation mechanisms in silicon is critical for reliable design of miniaturized devices operating at high temperatures. Bulk silicon is brittle, but it becomes ductile at about 540 °C. It creeps (deforms plastically with time) at high temperatures (∼800 °C). However, the effect of small size on ductility and creep of silicon remains elusive. Here, we report that silicon at small scales may deform plastically with time at lower temperatures (400 °C) above a threshold stress. We achieve this stress by bending single-crystal silicon microbeams using an in situ thermomechanical testing stage. Small size, together with bending, localize high stress near the surface of the beam close to the anchor. This localization offers flaw tolerance, allowing ductility to win over fracture. Our combined scanning, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy analysis reveals that as the threshold stress is approached, multiple dislocation nucleation sites appear simultaneously from the high-stressed surface of the beam with a uniform spacing of about 200 nm between them. Dislocations then emanate from these sites with time, lowering the stress while bending the beam plastically. This process continues until the effective shear stress drops and dislocation activities stop. A simple mechanistic model is presented to relate dislocation nucleation with plasticity in silicon.

Bulk silicon is brittle, but it becomes ductile at about 540 °C. It creeps (deforms plastically with time) at high temperatures (∼800 °C). However, the effect of small size on ductility and creep of silicon remains elusive. Here, we report that silicon at small scales may deform plastically with time at lower temperatures (400 °C) above a threshold stress. We achieve this stress by bending single-crystal silicon microbeams using an in situ thermomechanical testing stage. Small size, together with bending, localize high stress near the surface of the beam close to the anchor. This localization offers flaw tolerance, allowing ductility to win over fracture. Our combined scanning, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy analysis reveals that as the threshold stress is approached, multiple dislocation nucleation sites appear simultaneously from the high-stressed surface of the beam with a uniform spacing of about 200 nm between them. Dislocations then emanate from these sites with time, lowering the stress while bending the beam plastically. This process continues until the effective shear stress drops and dislocation activities stop. A simple mechanistic model is presented to relate dislocation nucleation with plasticity in silicon.

N2  - Recent work demonstrates that processes of stress release in prestrained elastomeric substrates can guide the assembly of sophisticated 3D micro/nanostructures in advanced materials. Reported application examples include soft electronic components, tunable electromagnetic and optical devices, vibrational metrology platforms, and other unusual technologies, each enabled by uniquely engineered 3D architectures. A significant disadvantage of these systems is that the elastomeric substrates, while essential to the assembly process, can impose significant engineering constraints in terms of operating temperatures and levels of dimensional stability; they also prevent the realization of 3D structures in freestanding forms. Here, we introduce concepts in interfacial photopolymerization, nonlinear mechanics, and physical transfer that bypass these limitations. The results enable 3D mesostructures in fully or partially freestanding forms, with additional capabilities in integration onto nearly any class of substrate, from planar, hard inorganic materials to textured, soft biological tissues, all via mechanisms quantitatively described by theoretical modeling. Illustrations of these ideas include their use in 3D structures as frameworks for templated growth of organized lamellae from AgCl–KCl eutectics and of atomic layers of WSe2 from vapor-phase precursors, as open-architecture electronic scaffolds for formation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neural networks, and as catalyst supports for propulsive systems in 3D microswimmers with geometrically controlled dynamics. Taken together, these methodologies establish a set of enabling options in 3D micro/nanomanufacturing that lie outside of the scope of existing alternatives.

N2  - Due to the limitations of fluorescence imaging techniques, the study of intracellular cargo is typically restricted to two-dimensional analyses. To overcome low light levels and the risk of phototoxicity, we employ quantitative phase imaging, a family of full-field imaging techniques that measure the optical path length shift introduced by the specimen. Specifically, we use spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) to study the transport of mass in whole tomographic volumes and show that a time-correlation technique, dispersion-relation phase spectroscopy (DPS), can be used to simultaneously assay the horizontal and vertical traffic of mass through a cell. To validate our method, we compare the traffic inside cell bodies and neuronal extensions, showing that the vertical transport of mass may prove a more sensitive and interesting metric than similar measurements limited to a 2D, horizontal plane.

N2  - Living cells are being extensively studied to build functional tissues that are useful for both fundamental and applied bioscience studies. Increasing evidence suggests that cell-cell adhesion controlled by the intercellular cadherin junction plays important roles in the quality of the resulting engineered tissue. These findings prompted efforts to interrogate biological effects of cadherin at a molecular scale; however, few efforts were made to harness the effects of cadherin on cells cultured in an in vivo-like three dimensional matrix. To this end, this study reports a hydrogel matrix three dimensionally functionalized with a controlled number of Fc-tagged recombinant N-cadherins (N-Cad-Fc). To retain the desired conformation of N-Cad, these cadherins were immobilized and oriented to the gel by anti-Fc-antibodies chemically coupled to gels. The gels were processed to present N-Cad-Fc in uniaxially aligned microchannels or randomly oriented micropores. Culturing cortical cells in the functionalized gels generated a large fraction of neurons that are functional as indicated by increased intracellular calcium ion concentrations with the microchanneled gel. In contrast, direct N-Cad-Fc immobilization to microchannel or micropore walls of the gel limited the growth of neurons and increased the glial to neuron ratio. The results of this study will be highly useful to organize a wide array of cadherin molecules in a series of biomaterials used for three-dimensional cell culture and to regulate phenotypic activities of tissue-forming cells in an elaborate manner.

N2  - Activity-dependent persistent changes in neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic strength are widely thought to underlie learning and memory. Voltage-gated KCNQ/Kv7 potassium channels have been of great interest as the potential targets for memory disorders due to the beneficial effects of their antagonists in cognition. Importantly, de novo dominant mutations in their neuronal subunits KCNQ2/Kv7.2 and KCNQ3/Kv7.3 are associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay and intellectual disability. The role of Kv7 channels in neuronal excitability and epilepsy has been extensively studied. However, their functional significance in neural plasticity, learning, and memory remains largely unknown. Here, we review recent studies that support the emerging roles of Kv7 channels in intrinsic and synaptic plasticity, and their contributions to cognition and behavior.

N2  - This paper presents a new method for testing materials at the microscale at high temperature under bending in-situ in SEM. The proposed method consists of a straining stage with built-in force and displacement sensors attached to a heating stage inside the SEM. The sample is co-fabricated with the stage to eliminate any misalignment error. The method is applied to test the strength of single crystal silicon (SCS) micro-beams under bending. At room temperature, bending tests revealed strengthening of SCS compared to that under uniform tension. This strengthening is contributed by stress localization near the surface of the beams close to the anchors, and the stress gradient from the surface to the neutral axis. The study further reveals significant reduction in the Brittle to Ductile Transition (BDT) temperature of SCS micro-beams compared to their bulk counterparts.

N2  - Statement of Purpose: Fibrin based matrices have been extensively used for three dimensional cell culture, tissue regeneration, and injectable cellular carrier due to their ability to support cell activities responsible for tissue regeneration1. However, there are still grand needs to control the gelation rate and the mechanical strength for enhanced transports and therapeutic efficacy of cells. This challenge results from a difficulty in regulating the gelation time while maintaining the mechanical properties and microstructure of fibrin matrices due to the complex protein polymerization mechanism2. To this end, this study demonstrates the stimulus-responsive poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microgelator that can activate fibrin fiber formation from their surfaces by actively ejecting thrombin in response to an external stimulus (i.e., hydrogen peroxide). The stimulus-responsive microgelator was assembled by simultaneously encapsulating MnO2 nanosheets that decompose H2O2 to O2 gas and thrombin into a spherical shell. We hypothesize that the microgelator would generates oxygen within the particles when exposed to H2O2. The oxygen gas will then act as force to pump out thrombin from the particles by increasing the internal pressure of particles. In the fibrinogen solution, the ejected thrombin molecules nucleate the fibrin fibers from the PLGA particle surface and finally form the interconnected fibrous networks with an increased elastic modulus, compared to the fibrin gel formed by mixing fibrinogen and thrombin in solution.

N2  - Mesenchymal stem cells are promising medicine for treating diseases and tissue defects because of their innate ability to secrete therapeutic factors. Intravenous delivery of stem cells, although favored for its minimal invasiveness, is often plagued by low cellular engraftment in the target tissue. To this end, this study hypothesizes that in situ activation of cellular expression of CXC chemokine 4 (CXCR4) would significantly improve cellular migration to injured tissue. This hypothesis was examined by tethering the surface of stem cells with poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)-block-hyaluronic acid (HA) particles containing stromal cell-derived factor-1α, a model chemokine to sensitize CXCR4. The HA blocks in the particles enhanced the association rate constant to stem cells by 3.3-fold, and in turn, increased the number of cells expressing CXCR4 receptors. Consequently, these cells displayed 1.2-fold higher transendothelial migration in vitro and 1.7-fold greater trafficking to the ischemic hindlimb of a mouse than that of the untethered cells.

Consequently, these cells displayed 1.2-fold higher transendothelial migration in vitro and 1.7-fold greater trafficking to the ischemic hindlimb of a mouse than that of the untethered cells.

N2  -                              Mesenchymal stem cells are the new generation of medicine for treating numerous vascular diseases and tissue defects because of their ability to secrete therapeutic factors. Poor cellular survival in an oxidative diseased tissue, however, hinders the therapeutic efficacy. To this end, we hypothesized that tethering the surface of stem cells with colloidal particles capable of discharging antioxidant cargos in response to elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide (H                             2                             O                             2                             ) would maintain survival and therapeutic activity of the stem cells. We examined this hypothesis by encapsulating epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and manganese oxide (MnO                             2                             ) nanocatalysts into particles comprising poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)-block-hyaluronic acid. The MnO                             2                              nanocatalysts catalyzed the decomposition of H                             2                             O                             2                              into oxygen gas, which increased the internal pressure of particles and accelerated the release of EGCG by 1.5-fold. Consequently, stem cells exhibited 1.2-fold higher metabolic activity and 2.8-fold higher secretion level of pro-angiogenic factor in sub-lethal H                             2                             O                             2                              concentrations. These stem cells, in turn, performed a greater angiogenic potential with doubled number of newly formed mature blood vessels. We envisage that the results of this study will contribute to improving the therapeutic efficacy of a wide array of stem cells.

N2  - Stem cell transplantation has been a promising treatment for peripheral arterial diseases in the past decade. Stem cells act as living bioreactors of paracrine factors that orchestrate tissue regeneration. Prestimulated adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have been proposed as potential candidates but have been met with challenges in activating their secretory activities for clinical use. Here, we propose that tethering the ADSC surface with nanoparticles releasing tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), named nanostimulator, would stimulate cellular secretory activity in situ. We examined this hypothesis by complexing octadecylamine-grafted hyaluronic acid onto a liposomal carrier of TNFα. Hyaluronic acid increased the liposomal stability and association to CD44 on ADSC surface. ADSCs tethered with these TNFα carriers exhibited up-regulated secretion of proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor and immunomodulatory prosteoglandin E2 (PGE2) while decreasing secretion of antiangiogenic pigment epithelium-derived factors. Accordingly, ADSCs tethered with nanostimulators promoted vascularization in a 3D microvascular chip and enhanced recovery of perfusion, walking, and muscle mass in a murine ischemic hindlimb compared to untreated ADSCs. We propose that this surface tethering strategy for in situ stimulation of stem cells would replace the costly and cumbersome preconditioning process and expedite clinical use of stem cells for improved treatments of various injuries and diseases.

N2  -                              Hydrogels have been used extensively to deliver functional molecular cargos in response to external mechanical force. However, the intrinsic brittleness of gels restricts the applicable range of strain to 0.1, thus limiting the range of molecular release rate that may be controlled. Also, uncontrollable molecular diffusion, which is especially prominent in small molecules, reduces the role of mechanical stimulus on the release rate. As such, we hypothesized that these challenges would be resolved by combining cyclodextrin, which may form guest-host complexes with small molecular cargos, with a stretchable hydrogel system. We examined this hypothesis by synthesizing cyclodextrin acrylate and incorporating it into a polyacrylamide gel that can be stretched by 100% of its original length. In the absence of external stretching, hydrogels containing cyclodextrin acrylate with a degree of acryloyl group substitution (DS                             A                             ) of 2.3 presented a lower molecular release rate than hydrogels without cyclodextrin acrylate. More interestingly, the polyacrylamide-cyclodextrin hydrogel system displayed an increased molecular release rate corresponding to the degree of stretching, particularly in the gels containing cyclodextrin acrylate with a DS                             A                              of 2.3. As such, this stretchable gel loaded with quinine was used to inhibit the growth of E. coli in lysogeny broth only when the gel was stretched. We believe the results of this study would be valuable for improving the quality of controlled molecular delivery and subsequent efficacy of molecular cargos.

N2  - Rheological measurements in which the applied stress or strain is oscillated are widely used to interrogate viscoelastic properties due to the independent control over the time scale and length scale afforded by changes in amplitude and frequency. Taking a nontraditional approach, we treat stress-controlled oscillatory tests as creep tests with transiently varying stress and apply an analysis typically used for steady creep and recovery experiments. Defining zero strain as the state prior to external shearing, it is shown that strain responses to small-amplitude oscillatory stressing are naturally shifted from the starting point by an amount proportional to the phase of the applied stress. The phenomenology is experimentally observed with entangled polymerlike micelles and polyethylene oxide solutions. A theory of strain shifting in the steady alternating state is provided based on recovery rheology, where differences between total strain and recoverable strains are acknowledged. User-controlled variables, such as the amplitude of the stress, the angular frequency, and the phase of the stress, as well a lone material parameter, the zero-shear viscosity, are shown to dictate the amount of shifting. A rapid and efficient approach of determining the zero-shear viscosity is, therefore, presented. We investigate the microstructural evolution via in situ small-angle neutron scattering when strain shifting appears. The microscopic orientation is shown to correlate to the recoverable strain independent of the shifting. Additional measurements are carried out on collagen, pluronic-hyaluronic acid, alginate gels, and polystyrene melts to show the generic nature of the strain shift phenomenon. In addition, we demonstrate that the strain-shift knowledge can be applied to determine the horizontal shift factor in time-temperature superposition, free of any numerical fitting procedures.

N2  - Various antioxidants are being used to neutralize the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduced in diseased tissues and contaminated environments. Polymer-directed crystallization of antioxidants has attracted attention as a way to control drug efficacy through molecular dissolution. However, most recrystallized antioxidants undertake continuous dissolution independent of the ROS level, thus causing side-effects. This study demonstrates a unique method to assemble antioxidant crystals that modulate their dissolution rate in response to the ROS level. We hypothesized that antioxidants recrystallized using a ROS-labile polymer would be triggered to dissolve when the ROS level increases. We examined this hypothesis by using catechin as a model antioxidant. Catechin was recrystallized using polyethylenimine cross-linked with ROS-labile diselanediylbis-(ethane-2,1-diyl)-diacrylate. Catechin crystallized with the ROS-labile polymer displays accelerated dissolution proportional to the H2O2 concentration. The ROS-responsive catechin crystals protect vascular cells from oxidative insults by activating intracellular glutathione peroxidase expression and, in turn, inhibiting an increase in the intracellular oxidative stress. In addition, ROS-responsive catechin crystals alleviate changes in the heart rate of Daphnia magna in oxidative media. We propose that the results of this study would be broadly useful for improving the therapeutic efficacy of a broad array of drug compounds.

N2  - The dispersion relation is fundamental to a physical phenomenon that develops in both space and time. This equation connects the spatial and temporal frequencies involved in the dynamic process through the material constants. Electromagnetic plane waves propagating in homogeneous media are bound by simple dispersion relation, which sets the magnitude of the spatial frequency, k, as being proportional to the temporal frequency, ω, with the proportionality constant dependent on the refractive index, n, and the speed of light in vacuum, c. Here we show that, for spatially broadband fields, an analog dispersion relation can be derived, except in this case the k-vector variance is connected with the temporal frequency through the statistics of the refractive index fluctuations in the medium. We discuss how this relationship can be used to retrieve information about refractive index distributions in biological tissues. This result is particularly significant in measurements of angular light scattering and quantitative phase imaging of biological structures.

N2  - The shortage of qualified human labor is a key challenge facing farmers, limiting profit margins and preventing the adoption of sustainable and diversified agroecosystems, such as agroforestry. New technologies in robotics could offer a solution to such limitations. Advances in soft arms and manipulators can enable agricultural robots that can have better reach and dexterity around plants than traditional robots equipped with hard industrial robotic arms. Soft robotic arms and manipulators can be far less expensive to manufacture and significantly lighter than their hard counterparts. Furthermore, they can be simpler to design and manufacture since they rely on fluidic pressurization as the primary mechanisms of operation. However, current soft robotic arms are difficult to design and control, slow to actuate, and have limited payloads. In this paper, we discuss the benefits and challenges of soft robotics technology and what it could mean for sustainable agriculture and agroforestry.

N2  - Sepsis, a life-threatening syndrome that contributes to millions of deaths annually worldwide, represents a moral and economic burden to the healthcare system. Although no single, or even a combination of biomarkers has been validated for the diagnosis of sepsis, multiple studies have shown the high specificity of CD64 expression on neutrophils (nCD64) to sepsis. The analysis of elevated nCD64 in the first 2-6 hours after infection during the pro-inflammatory stage could significantly contribute to early sepsis diagnosis. Therefore, a rapid and automated device to periodically measure nCD64 expression at the point-of-care (POC) could lead to timely medical intervention and reduced mortality rates. Current accepted technologies for measuring nCD64 expression, such as flow cytometry, require manual sample preparation and long incubation times. For POC applications, however, the technology should be able to measure nCD64 expression with little to no sample preparation. In this paper, we demonstrate a smartphone-imaged microfluidic biochip for detecting nCD64 expression in under 50 min. In our assay, first unprocessed whole blood is injected into a capture chamber to immunologically capture nCD64 along a staggered array of pillars, which were previously functionalized with an antibody against CD64. Then, an image of the capture channel is taken using a smartphone-based microscope. This image is used to measure the cumulative fraction of captured cells (γ) as a function of length in the channel. During the image analysis, a statistical model is fitted to γ in order to extract the probability of capture of neutrophils per collision with a pillar (ϵ). The fitting shows a strong correlation with nCD64 expression measured using flow cytometry (R2 = 0.82). Finally, the applicability of the device to sepsis was demonstrated by analyzing nCD64 from 8 patients (37 blood samples analyzed) along the time they were admitted to the hospital. Results from this analysis, obtained using the smartphone-imaged microfluidic biochip were compared with flow cytometry. Again, a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.82 (slope = 0.99) was obtained demonstrating a good linear correlation between the two techniques. Deployment of this technology in ICU could significantly enhance patient care worldwide.

N2  - Rapid, sensitive and specific detection and reporting of infectious pathogens is important for patient management and epidemic surveillance. We demonstrated a point-of-care system integrated with a smartphone for detecting live virus from nasal swab media, using a panel of equine respiratory infectious diseases as a model system for corresponding human diseases such as COVID-19. Specific nucleic acid sequences of five pathogens were amplified by loop-mediated isothermal amplification on a microfluidic chip and detected at the end of reactions by the smartphone. Pathogen-spiked horse nasal swab samples were correctly diagnosed using our system, with a limit of detection comparable to that of the traditional lab-based test, polymerase chain reaction, with results achieved in ∼30 minutes.

N2  - The intracellular environment is a dynamic space filled with various organelles moving in all directions. Included in this diverse group of organelles are vesicles, which are involved in transport of molecular cargo throughout the cell. Vesicles move in either a directed or non-directed fashion, often depending on interactions with cytoskeletal proteins such as microtubules, actin filaments, and molecular motors. How these proteins affect the local fluctuations of vesicles in the cytoplasm is not clear since they have the potential to both facilitate and impede movement. Here we show that vesicle mobility is significantly affected by myosin-II, even though it is not a cargo transport motor. We find that myosin-II activity increases the effective diffusivity of vesicles and its inhibition facilitates longer states of non-directed motion. Our study suggests that altering myosin-II activity in the cytoplasm of cells can modulate the mobility of vesicles, providing a possible mechanism for cells to dynamically tune the cytoplasmic environment in space and time.

N2  - Naked DNA has been shown to bind naturally to the sperm, a method called sperm-mediated gene transfer (SMGT). Based on these observations, we examined the efficiency of exogenous DNA binding to sperm using liposomes. In this experiment, we analyzed methods to select frozen-thawed bovine sperm, and evaluated the binding of exogenous DNA to those sperm. To determine the optimal selection method, we used Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA). Percoll or Swim-Up were used to select sperm, followed by incubation up to 3 h with the liposome-DNA complexes. The samples were collected after 1 h and after 3 h. We used enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in combination with the liposomes as a marker for exogenous DNA binding. Five treatments per selection method were analyzed: (1) no incubation, no liposomes and no DNA, (2) incubation with no liposomes and no DNA, (3) incubation with liposomes and no DNA, (4) incubation with liposomes and 1 µg of DNA and (5) incubation with liposomes and 10 µg of DNA. The CASA results for total motility and rapid motility were statistically significant (P < 0.01) between the control and the other treatments in the Percoll group as opposed to Swim-Up. Swim-Up was therefore chosen as the optimal selection method. In order to determine if the liposome-DNA complex had bound to sperm, real time PCR was used to detect GFP DNA and images of the sperm were analyzed using the Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM). SLIM confirmed the presence of liposomes on the sperm head and tail.

N2  - Biophysical studies on single cells have linked cell mechanics to physiology, functionality and disease. Evaluation of mass and viscoelasticity versus cell cycle can provide further insights into cell cycle progression and the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer. Using our pedestal microelectromechanical systems resonant sensors, we have developed a non-contact interferometric measurement technique that simultaneously tracks the dynamic changes in the viscoelastic moduli and mass of adherent colon (HT-29) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells from the interphase through mitosis and then to the cytokinesis stages of their growth cycle. We show that by combining three optomechanical parameters in an optical path length equation and a two-degree-of-freedom model, we can simultaneously extract the viscoelasticity and mass as a function of the nano-scaled membrane fluctuation of each adherent cell. Our measurements are able to discern between soft and stiff cells across the cell cycle and demonstrated sharp viscoelastic changes due to cortical stiffening around mitosis. Cell rounding before division can be detected by measurement of mechanical coupling between the cells and the sensors. Our measurement device and method can provide for new insights into the mechanics of single adherent cells versus time.

N2  - Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response, leads the U.S in both mortality rate and cost of treatment. Sepsis treatment protocols currently rely on broad and non-specific parameters like heart and respiration rate, and temperature; however, studies show that biomarkers Interlukin-6 (IL-6) and Procalcitonin (PCT) correlate to sepsis progression and response to treatment. Prior work also suggests that using multi-parameter predictive analytics with biomarkers and clinical information can inform treatment to improve outcome. A point-of-care (POC) platform that provides information for multiple biomarkers can aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of potentially septic patients. Using impedance cytometry, microbead immunoassays, and biotin-streptavidin binding, we report a microfluidic POC system that correlates microbead capture to IL-6 and PCT concentrations. A multiplexed microbead immunoassay is developed and validated for simultaneous detection of both IL-6 and PCT from human plasma samples. Using the POC platform, we quantified plasma samples containing healthy, medium (~103pg/ml) and high (~105pg/ml) IL-6 and PCT concentrations with various levels of significance (P < 0.05-P < 0.00001) and validated the concept of this device as a POC platform for sepsis biomarkers.

N2  - Characterizing the effects of force fields generated by cells on proliferation, migration and differentiation processes is challenging due to limited availability of nondestructive imaging modalities. Here, we integrate a new real-time traction stress imaging modality, Hilbert phase dynamometry (HPD), with spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) for simultaneous monitoring of cell growth during differentiation processes. HPD uses holographic principles to extract displacement fields from chemically patterned fluorescent grid on deformable substrates. This is converted into forces by solving an elasticity inverse problem. Since HPD uses the epi-fluorescence channel of an inverted microscope, cellular behavior can be concurrently studied in transmission with SLIM. We studied the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and found that cells undergoing osteogenesis and adipogenesis exerted larger and more dynamic stresses than their precursors, with MSCs developing the smallest forces and growth rates. Thus, we develop a powerful means to study mechanotransduction during dynamic processes where the matrix provides context to guide cells toward a physiological or pathological outcome.

N2  - The emergence and understanding of new design paradigms that exploit flow induced mechanical instabilities for propulsion or energy harvesting demands robust and accurate flow structure interaction numerical models. In this context, we develop a novel two dimensional algorithm that combines a Vortex Particle-Mesh (VPM) method and a Multi-Body System (MBS) solver for the simulation of passive and actuated structures in fluids. The hydrodynamic forces and torques are recovered through an innovative approach which crucially complements and extends the projection and penalization approach of Coquerelle et al. [1] and Gazzola et al. [2]. The resulting method avoids time consuming computation of the stresses at the wall to recover the force distribution on the surface of complex deforming shapes. This feature distinguishes the proposed approach from other VPM formulations. The methodology was verified against a number of benchmark results ranging from the sedimentation of a 2D cylinder to a passive three segmented structure in the wake of a cylinder. We then showcase the capabilities of this method through the study of an energy harvesting structure where the stocking process is modeled by the use of damping elements.

N2  - Advancing biologically driven soft robotics and actuators will involve employing different scaffold geometries and cellular constructs to enable a controllable emergence for increased production of force. By using hydrogel scaffolds and muscle tissue, soft biological robotic actuators that are capable of motility have been successfully engineered with varying morphologies. Having the flexibility of altering geometry while ensuring tissue viability can enable advancing functional output from these machines through the implementation of new construction concepts and fabrication approaches. This study reports a forward engineering approach to computationally design the next generation of biological machines via direct numerical simulations. This was subsequently followed by fabrication and characterization of high force producing biological machines. These biological machines show millinewton forces capable of driving locomotion at speeds above 0.5 mm s−1. It is important to note that these results are predicted by computational simulations, ultimately showing excellent agreement of the predictive models and experimental results, further providing the ability to forward design future generations of these biological machines. This study aims to develop the building blocks and modular technologies capable of scaling force and complexity of these devices for applications toward solving real world problems in medicine, environment, and manufacturing.

N2  - Viral-host interactomes map the complex architecture of an evolved arms race during host cell invasion. mRNA and protein interactomes reveal elaborate targeting schemes, yet evidence is lacking for genetic coupling that results in the co-regulation of promoters. Here we compare viral and human promoter sequences and expression to test whether genetic coupling exists and investigate its phenotypic consequences. We show that viral-host co-evolution is imprinted within promoter gene sequences before transcript or protein interactions. Co-regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human C-X-C chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) facilitates migration of infected cells. Upon infection, HIV can actively replicate or remain dormant. Migrating infected cells reactivate from dormancy more than non-migrating cells and exhibit differential migration-reactivation responses to drugs. Cells producing virus pose a risk for reinitiating infection within niches inaccessible to drugs, and tuning viral control of migration and reactivation improves strategies to eliminate latent HIV. Viral-host genetic coupling establishes a mechanism for synchronizing transcription and guiding potential therapies.

N2  - Viscous streaming flows generated by objects of constant curvature (circular cylinders, infinite plates) have been well understood. Yet, characterization and understanding of such flows when multiple body length scales are involved has not been looked into in rigorous detail. We propose a simplified setting to understand and explore the effect of multiple body curvatures on streaming flows, analysing the system through the lens of bifurcation theory. Our set-up consists of periodic, regular lattices of cylinders characterized by two distinct radii, so as to inject discrete curvatures into the system, which in turn affect the streaming field generated due to an oscillatory background flow. We demonstrate that our understanding based on this system, and in particular the role of bifurcations in determining the local flow topology, can be then generalized to a variety of individual convex shapes presenting a spectrum of curvatures, explaining prior experimental and computational observations. Thus, this study illustrates a route towards the rational manipulation of viscous streaming flow topology, through regulated variation of object geometry.

N2  - We report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of biodegradable amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)-b-polycarbonate-based diblock copolymers containing pendant persistent organic radicals (e.g., PROXYL). These paramagnetic radical-functionalized polymers self-assemble into micellar nanoparticles in aqueous media, which preferentially accumulate in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Through T1 relaxation NMR studies, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on mice, we show that these nanomaterials are effective as metal-free, biodegradable MRI contrast agents. We also demonstrate anticancer drugs can be readily loaded into the nanoparticles, conferring therapeutic delivery properties in addition to their imaging properties making these materials potential theranostic agents in the treatment of cancer.

N2  -                              Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Pathologic accumulation of soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers impairs synaptic plasticity and causes epileptic seizures, both of which contribute to cognitive dysfunction in AD. However, whether seizures could regulate Aβ-induced synaptic weakening remains unclear. Here we show that a single episode of electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) increased protein expression of membrane-associated STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP                             61                             ) and decreased tyrosine-phosphorylation of its substrates N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit GluN2B and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the rat hippocampus at 2 days following a single ECS. Interestingly, a significant decrease in ERK1/2 expression and an increase in APP and Aβ levels were observed at 3-4 days following a single ECS when STEP                             61                              level returned to the baseline. Given that pathologic levels of Aβ increase STEP                             61                              activity and STEP                             61                             -mediated dephosphorylation of GluN2B and ERK1/2 leads to NMDAR internalization and ERK1/2 inactivation, we propose that upregulation of STEP                             61                              and downregulation of GluN2B and ERK1/2 phosphorylation mediate compensatory weakening of synaptic strength in response to acute enhancement of hippocampal network activity, whereas delayed decrease in ERK1/2 expression and increase in APP and Aβ expression may contribute to the maintenance of this synaptic weakening.

N2  - Recent efforts to design a synthetic extracellular matrix for cell culture, engineering, and therapies greatly contributed to addressing biological roles of types and spatial organization of cell adhesion ligands. It is often suggested that ligand-matrix bond strength is another path to regulate cell adhesion and activities; however tools are lacking. To this end, this study demonstrates that a hydrogel coupled with integrin-binding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) tethers with pre-defined rupture forces can modulate cell adhesion, differentiation, and secretion activities due to the changes in the number and, likely, force of cells adhered to a gel. The rupture force of DNA tethers was tuned by altering the spatial arrangement of matrix-binding biotin groups. The DNA tethers were immobilized on a hydrogel of alginate grafted with biotin using avidin. Mesenchymal stem cells showed enhanced adhesion, neural differentiation, and paracrine secretion when cultured on the gel coupled with DNA tethers with higher rupture forces. Such innovative cell-matrix interface engineering would be broadly useful for a series of materials used for fundamental and applied studies on biological cells.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the shortcomings in the deployment of state-of-the-art diagnostic platforms. Although several PCR-based techniques have been rapidly developed to meet the growing testing needs, such techniques often need samples collected through a swab, the use of RNA extraction kits, and expensive thermocyclers in order to successfully perform the test. Isothermal amplification-based approaches have also been recently demonstrated for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection by minimizing sample preparation while also reducing the instrumentation and reaction complexity. There are limited reports of saliva as the sample source and some of these indicate inferior sensitivity when comparing RT-LAMP with PCR-based techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate an improved sensitivity assay to test saliva using a 2-step RT-LAMP assay, where a short 10-minute RT step is performed with only B3 and BIP primers before the final reaction. We show that while the 1-step RT-LAMP demonstrate satisfactory results, the optimized 2-step approach allows for single molecule sensitivity per reaction and performs significantly better than the 1-step RT-LAMP and conventional 2-step RT-LAMP approaches with all primers included in the RT Step. Importantly, we demonstrate RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP based assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from VTM and saliva clinical samples.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe following reagents were obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: (i) Genomic RNA from Zika Virus, PRVABC59, NR-50244; (ii) Zika Virus, PRVABC59, NR-50240.

N2  - Detection of nucleic acid molecules is one of the most pervasive assays in biology, medicine, and agriculture applications. Currently, most comely used DNA/RNA detection platforms use fluorescence labeling and require lab-scale setting for performing the assay. There is a need for developing less expensive, label-free, and rapid detection of biomolecules with minimal utilization of resources. Use of electrical approaches for detection of biomolecules by utilizing their inherent charge is a promising direction for biosensing assays. Here, we report a 1024 × 1024 array of Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistors (ISFET) as label free sensors for detection of nucleic acid molecules. Using PNA probe functionalized on these ISFET array, we robustly detected miRNA Let-7b by measuring changes in drain current after hybridization of target molecules with concentration as low as 1 nM. We demonstrate that mismatched or non-complementary target molecules resulted in statistically smaller changes. Most importantly, the high-density sensor array shows unprecedented reliability and robustness with P values <0.0001 for all experiments. Practical implementation of this platform could have a wide range of applications in high-throughput nucleic acid genotyping, detection of amplified pathogenic nucleic acid, detection of cell-free DNA, and electrical readouts for current hybridization-based DNA biomolecular assays.

N2  - The ability to evaluate sperm at the microscopic level, at highthroughput, would be useful for assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), as it can allow specific selection of sperm cells for in vitro fertilization (IVF). The tradeoff between intrinsic imaging and external contrast agents is particularly acute in reproductive medicine. The use of fluorescence labels has enabled new cellsorting strategies and given new insights into developmental biology. Nevertheless, using extrinsic contrast agents is often too invasive for routine clinical operation. Raising questions about cell viability, especially for single-cell selection, clinicians prefer intrinsic contrast in the form of phase-contrast, differential-interference contrast, or Hoffman modulation contrast. While such instruments are nondestructive, the resulting image suffers from a lack of specificity. In this work, we provide a template to circumvent the tradeoff between cell viability and specificity by combining highsensitivity phase imaging with deep learning. In order to introduce specificity to label-free images, we trained a deep-convolutional neural network to perform semantic segmentation on quantitative phase maps. This approach, a form of phase imaging with computational specificity (PICS), allowed us to efficiently analyze thousands of sperm cells and identify correlations between dry-mass content and artificial-reproduction outcomes. Specifically, we found that the dry-mass content ratios between the head, midpiece, and tail of the cells can predict the percentages of success for zygote cleavage and embryo blastocyst formation.

N2  - The refractive index distribution of cells and tissues governs their interaction with light and can report on morphological modifications associated with disease. Through intensity-based measurements, refractive index information can be extracted only via scattering models that approximate light propagation. As a result, current knowledge of refractive index distributions across various tissues and cell types remains limited. Here we use quantitative phase imaging and the statistical dispersion relation (SDR) to extract information about the refractive index variance in a variety of specimens. Due to the phase-resolved measurement in three-dimensions, our approach yields refractive index results without prior knowledge about the tissue thickness. With the recent progress in quantitative phase imaging systems, we anticipate that using SDR will become routine in assessing tissue optical properties.

N2  - Neuronal Kv7/KCNQ channels are voltage-gated potassium channels composed of Kv7.2/KCNQ2 and Kv7.3/KCNQ3 subunits. Enriched at the axonal membrane, they potently suppress neuronal excitability. De novo and inherited dominant mutations in Kv7.2 cause early onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by drug resistant seizures and profound psychomotor delay. However, their precise pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated selected epileptic encephalopathy causing mutations in calmodulin (CaM)-binding helices A and B of Kv7.2. We discovered that R333W, K526N, and R532W mutations located peripheral to CaM contact sites decreased axonal surface expression of heteromeric channels although only R333W mutation reduced CaM binding to Kv7.2. These mutations also altered gating modulation by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), revealing novel PIP2 binding residues. While these mutations disrupted Kv7 function to suppress excitability, hyperexcitability was observed in neurons expressing Kv7.2-R532W that displayed severe impairment in voltage-dependent activation. The M518 V mutation at the CaM contact site in helix B caused most defects in Kv7 channels by severely reducing their CaM binding, K+ currents, and axonal surface expression. Interestingly, the M518 V mutation induced ubiquitination and accelerated proteasome-dependent degradation of Kv7.2, whereas the presence of Kv7.3 blocked this degradation. Furthermore, expression of Kv7.2-M518V increased neuronal death. Together, our results demonstrate that epileptic encephalopathy mutations in helices A and B of Kv7.2 cause abnormal Kv7 expression and function by disrupting Kv7.2 binding to CaM and/or modulation by PIP2. We propose that such multiple Kv7 channel defects could exert more severe impacts on neuronal excitability and health, and thus serve as pathogenic mechanisms underlying Kcnq2 epileptic encephalopathy.

N2  - Tissue birefringence is an intrinsic marker of potential value for cancer diagnosis. Traditionally, birefringence properties have been studied by using intensity-based formalisms, through the Mueller matrix algebra. On the other hand, the Jones matrix description allows for a direct assessment of the sample’s anisotropic response. However, because Jones algebra is based on complex fields, requiring measurements of both phase and amplitude, it is less commonly used. Here we propose a real-time imaging method for measuring Jones matrices by quantitative phase imaging. We combine a broadband phase imaging system with a polarization-sensitive detector to obtain Jones matrices at each point in a megapixel scale image, with near video rate capture speeds. To validate the utility of our approach, we measured standard targets, partially birefringent samples, dynamic specimens, and thinly sliced histopathological tissue.

N2  - As a label-free, nondestructive method, phase contrast is by far the most popular microscopy technique for routine inspection of cell cultures. However, features of interest such as extensions near cell bodies are often obscured by a glow, which came to be known as the halo. Advances in modeling image formation have shown that this artifact is due to the limited spatial coherence of the illumination. Nevertheless, the same incoherent illumination is responsible for superior sensitivity to fine details in the phase contrast geometry. Thus, there exists a trade-off between high-detail (incoherent) and low-detail (coherent) imaging systems. In this work, we propose a method to break this dichotomy, by carefully mixing corrected low-frequency and high-frequency data in a way that eliminates the edge effect. Specifically, our technique is able to remove halo artifacts at video rates, requiring no manual interaction or a priori point spread function measurements. To validate our approach, we imaged standard spherical beads, sperm cells, tissue slices, and red blood cells. We demonstrate real-time operation with a time evolution study of adherent neuron cultures whose neurites are revealed by our halo correction. We show that with our novel technique, we can quantify cell growth in large populations, without the need for thresholds and system variant calibration.

N2  - Neurodegenerative diseases and disorders seriously impact memory and cognition and can become life-threatening. Current medical techniques attempt to combat these detrimental effects mainly through the administration of neuromedicine. However, drug efficacy is limited by rapid dispersal of the drugs to off-target sites while the site of administration is prone to overdose. Many neuropathological conditions are accompanied by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the inflammatory response. Accordingly, ROS-responsive drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising solution. To guide intelligent and comprehensive design of ROS-responsive drug delivery systems, this review article discusses the two following topics: (1) the biology of ROS in both healthy and diseased nervous systems and (2) recent developments in ROS-responsive, drug delivery system design. Overall, this review article would assist efforts to make better decisions about designing ROS-responsive, neural drug delivery systems, including the selection of ROS-responsive functional groups.

N2  - Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis revealed that fast, accurate, and scalable testing is crucial for curbing the current impact and that of future pandemics. We propose an optical method for directly imaging unlabeled viral particles and using deep learning for detection and classification. An ultrasensitive interferometric method was used to image four virus types with nanoscale optical pathlength sensitivity. Pairing these data with fluorescence images for ground truth, we trained semantic segmentation models based on U-Net, a particular type of convolutional neural network. The trained network was applied to classify the viruses from the interferometric images only, containing simultaneously SARS-CoV-2, H1N1 (influenza-A), HAdV (adenovirus), and ZIKV (Zika). Remarkably, due to the nanoscale sensitivity in the input data, the neural network was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 vs. the other viruses with 960 ms, on a common graphic processing unit. This approach of directly imaging unlabeled viral particles may provide an extremely fast test, of less than a minute per patient. As the imaging instrument operates on regular glass slides, we envision this method as potentially testing on patient breath condensates.The necessary high throughput can be achieved by translating concepts from digital pathology, where a microscope can scan hundreds of slides automatically.One Sentence Summary This work proposes a rapid (lt;1 min.), label-free testing method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, using quantitative phase imaging and deep learning.Competing Interest StatementG.P. and C.B-P. have financial interests in Phi Optics Inc., a company that manufactures quantitative phase imaging instruments for biomedical applications.

N2  - Rapid, low-cost, and multiplexed biomolecule detection is an important goal in the development of effective molecular diagnostics. Our recent work has demonstrated a microfluidic biochip device that can electrically quantitate a protein target with high sensitivity. This platform detects and quantifies a target analyte by counting and capturing micron-sized beads in response to an immunoassay on the bead surface. Existing microparticles limit the technique to the detection of a single protein target and lack the magnetic properties required for separation of the microparticles for direct measurements from whole blood. Here, we report new precisely engineered microparticles that achieve electrical multiplexing and adapt this platform for low-cost and label-free multiplexed electrical detection of biomolecules. Droplet microfluidic synthesis yielded highly-monodisperse populations of magnetic hydrogel beads (MHBs) with the necessary properties for multiplexing the electrical Coulter counting on chip. Each bead population was designed to contain a different amount of the hydrogel material, resulting in a unique electrical impedance signature during Coulter counting, thereby enabling unique identification of each bead. These monodisperse bead populations span a narrow range of sizes ensuring that all can be captured sensitively and selectively under simultaneously flow. Incorporating these newly synthesized beads, we demonstrate versatile and multiplexed biomolecule detection of proteins or DNA targets. This development of multiplexed beads for the electrical detection of biomolecules, provides a critical advancement towards multiplexing the Coulter counting approach and the development of a low cost point-of-care diagnostic sensor.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic provides an urgent example where a gap exists between availability of state-of-the-art diagnostics and current needs. As assay protocols and primer sequences become widely known, many laboratories perform diagnostic tests using methods such as RT-PCR or reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Here, we report an RT-LAMP isothermal assay for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and demonstrate the assay on clinical samples using a simple and accessible point-of-care (POC) instrument. We characterized the assay by dipping swabs into synthetic nasal fluid spiked with the virus, moving the swab to viral transport medium (VTM), and sampling a volume of the VTM to perform the RT-LAMP assay without an RNA extraction kit. The assay has a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 RNA copies per μL in the VTM solution within 30 min. We further demonstrate our assay by detecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses from 20 clinical samples. Finally, we demonstrate a portable and real-time POC device to detect SARS-CoV-2 from VTM samples using an additively manufactured three-dimensional cartridge and a smartphone-based reader. The POC system was tested using 10 clinical samples, and was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 from these clinical samples by distinguishing positive samples from negative samples after 30 min. The POC tests are in complete agreement with RT-PCR controls. This work demonstrates an alternative pathway for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics that does not require conventional laboratory infrastructure, in settings where diagnosis is required at the point of sample collection.

progression involves complex signals within the tumor microenvironment 
that orchestrate proliferation and invasive processes. The mechanical 
properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within this 
microenvironment has been demonstrated to influence growth and the 
migratory phenotype that precedes invasion. Here we present the 
integration of a label-free quantitative phase imaging technique, 
spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM)—with protein-conjugated 
hydrogel substrates—to explore how the stiffness of the ECM influences 
melanoma cells of varying metastatic potential. Melanoma cells of high 
metastatic potential demonstrate increased growth and velocity 
characteristics relative to cells of low metastatic potential. Cell 
velocity in the highly metastatic population shows a relative stability 
at higher matrix stiffness suggesting adoption of migratory routines 
that are independent of mechanics to facilitate invasion. The use of 
SLIM and engineered substrates provides a new approach to characterize 
the invasive properties of live cells as a function of microenvironment 
parameters. This work provides fundamental insight into the relationship
 between growth, migration and metastatic potential, and provides a new 
tool for profiling cancer cells for clinical grading and development of 
patient-specific therapeutic regimens.

N2  - Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is an emerging label-free modality that attracts significant interest in biomedicine in general and neuroscience in particular. Based on the principle of interferometry, QPI precisely maps the optical pathlength induced by the sample, and, thus, can visualize extremely transparent samples. The QPI field has grown rapidly in the past decade, and reliable instruments have been developed for in-depth biological studies. One particular figure of merit associated with QPI techniques describes the temporal phase sensitivity of instruments. Recently, several common path interferometry methods have been developed, which yield high stability and nanometer scale pathlength sensitivity. In neuroscience, QPI has shown unique capabilities in quantifying neural growth and dynamics in cell cultures, as well as high contrast imaging of brain tissue slices. In this paper, we review the principles of QPI, novel QPI technology, advances in data processing, and a number of exciting applications in neuroscience.

N2  - In this paper, we extend our recent work on partially coherent quantitative phase imaging (pcQPI) from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) imaging of weakly scattering samples. Due to the mathematical complexity, most theoretical modeling of quantitative phase image formation under partial coherence has focused on thin, well-focused samples. It is unclear how these abberations are affected by defocusing. Also, as 3D QPI techniques continue to develop, a better model needs to be developed to understand and quantify these aberrations when imaging thicker samples. Here, using the first order Born's approximation, we derived a mathematical framework that provides an intuitive model of image formation under varying degrees of coherence. Our description provides a clear connection between the halo effect and phase underestimation, defocusing and the 3D structure of the sample under investigation. Our results agree very well with the experiments and show that the microscope objective defines the sectioning ability of the imaging system while the condenser lens is responsible for the halo effect.

Second harmonic generation microscopy has been used to show that collagen fiber alignment in PDAC is a negative prognostic factor. In this work, a series of PDAC and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) biopsies were imaged with spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM). Quantitative analysis performed on the biopsy SLIM images show that PDAC fiber structures have lower alignment per unit length, narrower width, and are longer than NAT controls. Importantly, fibrillar collagen in PDAC shows an inverse relationship between survival data and fiber width and length (p < 0.05).

N2  - Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) has emerged as a valuable method for investigating cells and tissues. QPI operates on unlabelled specimens and, as such, is complementary to established fluorescence microscopy, exhibiting lower phototoxicity and no photobleaching. As the images represent quantitative maps of optical path length delays introduced by the specimen, QPI provides an objective measure of morphology and dynamics, free of variability due to contrast agents. Owing to the tremendous progress witnessed especially in the past 10–15 years, a number of technologies have become sufficiently reliable and translated to biomedical laboratories. Commercialization efforts are under way and, as a result, the QPI field is now transitioning from a technology-development-driven to an application-focused field. In this Review, we aim to provide a critical and objective overview of this dynamic research field by presenting the scientific context, main principles of operation and current biomedical applications.

N2  - Optical microscopy is an indispensable diagnostic tool in modern healthcare. As a prime example, pathologists rely exclusively on light microscopy to investigate tissue morphology in order to make a diagnosis. While advances in light microscopy and contrast markers allow pathologists to visualize cells and tissues in unprecedented detail, the interpretation of these images remains largely subjective, leading to inter- and intra-observer discrepancy. Furthermore, conventional microscopy images capture qualitative information which makes it difficult to automate the process, reducing the throughput achievable in the diagnostic workflow. Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) techniques have been advanced in recent years to address these two challenges. By quantifying physical parameters of cells and tissues, these systems remove subjectivity from the disease diagnosis process and allow for easier automation to increase throughput. In addition to providing quantitative information, QPI systems are also label-free and can be easily assimilated into the current diagnostic workflow in the clinic. In this paper we review the advances made in disease diagnosis by QPI techniques. We focus on the areas of hematological diagnosis and cancer pathology, which are the areas where most significant advances have been made to date. (Figure presented.) [Image adapted from Y. Park, M.

N2  - Tissue biopsy evaluation in the clinic is in need of quantitative disease markers for diagnosis and, most importantly, prognosis. Among the new technologies, quantitative phase imaging (QPI) has demonstrated promise for histopathology because it reveals intrinsic tissue nanoarchitecture through the refractive index. However, a vast majority of past QPI investigations have relied on imaging unstained tissues, which disrupts the established specimen processing. Here we present color spatial light interference microscopy (cSLIM) as a new whole-slide imaging modality that performs interferometric imaging on stained tissue, with a color detector array. As a result, cSLIM yields in a single scan both the intrinsic tissue phase map and the standard color bright-field image, familiar to the pathologist. Our results on 196 breast cancer patients indicate that cSLIM can provide stain-independent prognostic information from the alignment of collagen fibers in the tumor microenvironment. The effects of staining on the tissue phase maps were corrected by a mathematical normalization. These characteristics are likely to reduce barriers to clinical translation for the new cSLIM technology.

However, a vast majority of past QPI investigations have relied on imaging unstained tissues, which disrupts the established specimen processing. Here we present color spatial light interference microscopy (cSLIM) as a new whole-slide imaging modality that performs interferometric imaging on stained tissue, with a color detector array. As a result, cSLIM yields in a single scan both the intrinsic tissue phase map and the standard color bright-field image, familiar to the pathologist. Our results on 196 breast cancer patients indicate that cSLIM can provide stain-independent prognostic information from the alignment of collagen fibers in the tumor microenvironment. The effects of staining on the tissue phase maps were corrected by a mathematical normalization. These characteristics are likely to reduce barriers to clinical translation for the new cSLIM technology.

N2  - Optimal growth as well as branching of axons and dendrites is critical for the nervous system function. Neuritic length, arborization, and growth rate determine the innervation properties of neurons and define each cell's computational capability. Thus, to investigate the nervous system function, we need to develop methods and instrumentation techniques capable of quantifying various aspects of neural network formation: Neuron process extension, retraction, stability, and branching. During the last three decades, fluorescence microscopy has yielded enormous advances in our understanding of neurobiology. While fluorescent markers provide valuable specificity to imaging, photobleaching, and photoxicity often limit the duration of the investigation. Here, we used spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) to measure quantitatively neurite outgrowth as a function of cell confluence. Because it is label-free and nondestructive, SLIM allows for long-term investigation over many hours. We found that neurons exhibit a higher growth rate of neurite length in low-confluence versus mediumand high-confluence conditions. We believe this methodology will aid investigators in performing unbiased, nondestructive analysis of morphometric neuronal parameters.

N2  - Deficient myelination of the brain is associated with neurodevelopmental delays, particularly in high-risk infants, such as those born small in relation to their gestational age (SGA). New methods are needed to further study this condition. Here, we employ Color Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (cSLIM), which uses a brightfield objective and RGB camera to generate pathlength-maps with nanoscale sensitivity in conjunction with a regular brightfield image. Using tissue sections stained with Luxol Fast Blue, the myelin structures were segmented from a brightfield image. Using a binary mask, those portions were quantitatively analyzed in the corresponding phase maps. We first used the CLARITY method to remove tissue lipids and validate the sensitivity of cSLIM to lipid content. We then applied cSLIM to brain histology slices. These specimens are from a previous MRI study, which demonstrated that appropriate for gestational age (AGA) piglets have increased internal capsule myelination (ICM) compared to small for gestational age (SGA) piglets and that a hydrolyzed fat diet improved ICM in both. The identity of samples was blinded until after statistical analyses.

N2  - Tumor progression in breast cancer is significantly influenced by its interaction with the surrounding stromal tissue. Specifically, the composition, orientation, and alignment of collagen fibers in tumor-adjacent stroma affect tumor growth and metastasis. Most of the work done on measuring this prognostic marker has involved imaging of collagen fibers using second-harmonic generation microscopy (SHGM), which provides label-free specificity. Here, we show that spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM), a label-free quantitative phase imaging technique, is able to provide information on collagen-fiber orientation that is comparable to that provided by SHGM. Due to its wide-field geometry, the throughput of the SLIM system is much higher than that of SHGM and, because of the linear imaging, the equipment is simpler and significantly less expensive. Our results indicate that SLIM images can be used to extract important prognostic information from collagen fibers in breast tissue, potentially providing a convenient high throughput clinical tool for assessing patient prognosis.

N2  - Recurrent high-frequency epileptic seizures cause progressive hippocampal sclerosis, which is associated with caspase-3 activation and NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity. However, the identity of caspase-3 substrates that contribute to seizure-induced hippocampal atrophy remains largely unknown. Here, we show that prolonged high-frequency epileptiform discharges in cultured hippocampal neurons leads to caspase-dependent cleavage of GIRK1 and GIRK2, the major subunits of neuronal G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels that mediate membrane hyperpolarization and synaptic inhibition in the brain. We have identified caspase-3 cleavage sites in GIRK1 (387ECLD390) and GIRK2 (349YEVD352). The YEVD motif is highly conserved in GIRK2-4, and located within their C-terminal binding sites for Gβγ proteins that mediate membrane-delimited GIRK activation. Indeed, the cleaved GIRK2 displays reduced binding to Gβγ and cannot coassemble with GIRK1. Loss of an ER export motif upon cleavage of GIRK2 abolishes surface and current expression of GIRK2 homotetramic channels. Lastly, kainate-induced status epilepticus causes GIRK1 and GIRK2 cleavage in the hippocampus in vivo. Our findings are the first to show direct cleavage of GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits by caspase-3, and suggest the possible role of caspase-3 mediated down-regulation of GIRK channel function and expression in hippocampal neuronal injury during prolonged epileptic seizures.

N2  - 3D hydrogel scaffolds are widely used in cellular microcultures and tissue engineering. Using direct ink writing, microperiodic poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (pHEMA) scaffolds are created that are then printed, cured, and modified by absorbing 30 kDa protein poly-l-lysine (PLL) to render them biocompliant in model NIH/3T3 fibroblast and MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cell cultures. Spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) live cell imaging studies are carried out to quantify cellular motilities for each cell type, substrate, and surface treatment of interest. 3D scaffold mechanics is investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM), while their absorption kinetics are determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) for a series of hydrated hydrogel films prepared from prepolymers with different homopolymer-to-monomer (Mr) ratios. The observations reveal that the inks with higher Mr values yield relatively more open-mesh gels due to a lower degree of entanglement. The biocompatibility of printed hydrogel scaffolds can be controlled by both PLL content and hydrogel mesh properties.

N2  - Background: An electrically conductive hydrogel has emerged to regulate cellular secretion activities with electrical stimulation. However, the electrical conductivity of typical hydrogel systems decreases with increasing elastic modulus of the hydrogels because of decreased transport of ions through a polymeric cross-linked mesh. Method: This study hypothesized that the inverse dependency between electrical conductivity and elastic modulus would be made through the cross-linking of conductive monomer-units conjugated to a hydrophilic polymeric backbone. This hypothesis was examined through the cross-linking of pyrrole groups that were conjugated to an alginate backbone, termed alginate-g-pyrrole. Results: Hydrogels with increased degrees of pyrrole substitution exhibited a simultaneous increase in the gels mechanical rigidity and electrical conductivity. The resulting hydrogel could control the adhesion and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion of cells via applied electrical stimulation. Conclusions: This material design principle will be broadly useful to fabricating materials used for various actuation, cell culture, and biomedical applications.

N2  - Materials used in organ mimics for medial simulation and education require tissue-like softness, toughness, and hydration to give clinicians and students accurate tactile feedback. However, there is a lack of materials that satisfy these requirements. Herein, we demonstrate that a stretchable and tough polyacrylamide hydrogel is useful to build organ mimics that match softness, crack growth resistance, and interstitial water of real organs. Varying the acrylamide concentration between 29 or 62% w/w with a molar ratio between cross-linker and acrylamide of 1 : 10 800 resulted in a fracture energy around ∼2000 J m-2. More interestingly, this tough gel permitted variation of the elastic modulus from 8 to 62 kPa, which matches the softness of brain to vascular and muscle tissue. According to the rheological frequency sweep, the tough polyacrylamide hydrogels had a greatly decreased number of flow units, indicating that when deformed, stress was dispersed over a greater area. We propose that such molecular dissipation results from the increased number of entangled polymers between distant covalent cross-links. The gel was able to undergo various manipulations including stretching, puncture, delivery through a syringe tip, and suturing, thus enabling the use of the gel as a blood vessel model for microsurgery simulation.

N2  - Prediction of biochemical recurrence risk of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy is critical for determining whether the patient would benefit from adjuvant treatments. Various nomograms exist today for identifying individuals at higher risk for recurrence; however, an optimistic under-estimation of recurrence risk is a common problem associated with these methods. We previously showed that anisotropy of light scattering measured using quantitative phase imaging, in the stromal layer adjacent to cancerous glands, is predictive of recurrence. That nested-case controlled study consisted of specimens specifically chosen such that the current prognostic methods fail. Here we report on validating the utility of optical anisotropy for prediction of prostate cancer recurrence in a general population of 192 patients, with 17% probability of recurrence. Our results show that our method can identify recurrent cases with 73% sensitivity and 72% specificity, which is comparable to that of CAPRA-S, a current state of the art method, in the same population. However, our results show that optical anisotropy outperforms CAPRA-S for patients with Gleason grades 7-10. In essence, we demonstrate that anisotropy is a better biomarker for identifying high-risk cases, while Gleason grade is better suited for selecting non-recurrence. Therefore, we propose that anisotropy and current techniques be used together to maximize prediction accuracy.

N2  - In recent years, lymphangiogenesis, the process of lymphatic vessel formation from existing lymph vessels, has been demonstrated to have a significant role in diverse pathologies, including cancer metastasis, organ graft rejection, and lymphedema. Our understanding of the mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis has advanced on the heels of studies demonstrating vascular endothelial growth factor C as a central pro-lymphangiogenic regulator and others identifying multiple lymphatic endothelial biomarkers. Despite these breakthroughs and a growing appreciation of the signaling events that govern the lymphangiogenic process, there are no FDA-approved drugs that target lymphangiogenesis. In this review, we reflect on the lessons available from the development of antiangiogenic therapies (26 FDA-approved drugs to date), review current lymphangiogenesis research including nanotechnology in therapeutic drug delivery and imaging, and discuss molecules in the lymphangiogenic pathway that are promising therapeutic targets.

N2  - Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an attractive chemical because of its bleaching properties in paper and pulp industry and as a disinfectant in the food, water, and medical industries. However, it is important to monitor the residual H2O2 level after its usage and prevent any unintended health problems or chemical reactions. Most H2O2 sensors often utilize fluorophores or electrical circuitry that requires an additional irradiation or a digital display. To this end, this study presents a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)/horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-loaded patch that alerts the presence of high H2O2 levels by generating a visible blue color. We hypothesized that water-insoluble TMB immobilized within mesoporous silica particles of proper pore diameter and structure would act as a colorimetric indicator through the H2O2-mediated oxidation within a cross-linked patch. We examined this hypothesis by immobilizing TMB molecules in mesoporous silica particles with 2 and 7 nm diameter cylindrical pores as well as on nonporous silica particles. Then, we loaded these TMB-silica particles and HRP in a porous alginate patch via sequential in situ cross-linking reaction and lyophilization. In the presence of 25-5000 μM H2O2, which simulate H2O2 concentrations found in residual disinfecting fluids, the patch loaded with TMB-mesoporous silica particles with 7 nm diameter pores generated a distinct blue color with varying intensities depending on the H2O2 concentration. The design principles demonstrated in this study should be applicable to a broad array of sensors to be integrated into a moldable, three-dimensional matrix.

N2  - For the past few decades, efforts have been extensively made to reproduce tissue of interests for various uses including fundamental bioscience studies, clinical treatments, and even soft robotic systems. In these studies, cells are often cultured in micropores introduced in a provisional matrix despite that bulk rigidity may negatively affect cellular differentiation involved in tissue formation. To this end, we hypothesized that suspending cells within a soft fibrous matrix that is encapsulated within the microchannels of a provisional matrix would allow us to mediate effects of the matrix rigidity on cells and, in turn, to increase the cell differentiation level. We examined this hypothesis by filling microchannels interpenetrating alginate matrices with collagen gels of controlled elastic moduli (i.e., 125 to 1 Pa). Myoblasts used as a model predifferentiated cell were suspended within the collagen gels. The elastic modulus of the collagen gels was decreased through the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) during the gel preparation. Myoblasts loaded in the collagen gel exhibited a higher myogenic differentiation level than those adhered to the collagen-coated microchannel wall. Furthermore, the collagen gel softened by poly(ethylene glycol) further increased the volume of the multinucleated myofibers. The role of collagen gel softness on cell differentiation became more significant when the bulk elastic modulus of the alginate matrix was tuned to be close to that of muscle tissue (i.e., 11 kPa). We believe that the results of this study would be useful to understanding phenotypic activities of a wide array of cells involved in tissue development and regeneration.

N2  - Polycystin 2 (PC2 or TRPP1, formerly TRPP2) is a calcium-permeant Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) cation channel expressed primarily on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and primary cilia of all cell and tissue types. Despite its ubiquitous expression throughout the body, studies of PC2 have focused primarily on its role in the kidney, as mutations in PC2 lead to the development of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a debilitating condition for which there is no cure. However, the endogenous role that PC2 plays in the regulation of general cellular homeostasis remains unclear. In this study, we measure how PC2 expression changes in different pathological states, determine that its abundance is increased under conditions of cellular stress in multiple tissues including human disease, and conclude that PC2-deficient cells have increased susceptibility to cell death induced by stress. Our results offer new insight into the normal function of PC2 as a ubiquitous stress-sensitive protein whose expression is up-regulated in response to cell stress to protect against pathological cell death in multiple diseases.

N2  - Point-of-care sensors that enable the fast collection of information relevant to a patient’s health state can facilitate improved health access, reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare delivery. In the diagnosis of sepsis — defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and the leading cause of in-patient death and of hospital readmission in the United States — predicting which infections will lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction and developing specific anti-sepsis treatments remain challenging because of the significant heterogeneity of the host response. Yet the use of point-of-care devices could reduce the time from the onset of a patient’s infection to the administration of appropriate therapeutics. In this Perspective, we describe the current state of point-of-care sensors for the diagnosis and monitoring of sepsis, and outline opportunities in the use of these devices to dramatically improve patient care.

N2  - Here, we present a technique that performs on-chip picoliter real-time reverse transcriptase loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) reactions on a histological tissue section without any analyte purification while preserving the native spatial location of the nucleic acid molecules. We demonstrate this method by amplifying TOP2A messenger RNA (mRNA) in a prostate cancer xenograft with 100 μm spatial resolution and by visualizing the variation in threshold time of amplification across the tissue. The on-chip reaction was validated by mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) from cells in the tissue section. The entire process, from tissue loading on microchip to results from RT-LAMP can be carried out in less than 2 h. We anticipate that this technique, with its ease of use, fast turnaround, and quantitative molecular outputs, would become an invaluable tissue analysis tool for researchers and clinicians in the biomedical arena.

N2  - Results from a variety of sources indicate a role for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in light/glutamate-induced phase resetting of the circadian clock mediated by the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Attempts to block or remove PACAP’s contribution to clock-resetting have generated phenotypes that differ in their responses to light or glutamate. For example, previous studies of circadian behaviors found that period-maintenance and early-night phase delays are intact in PACAP-null mice, yet there is a consistent deficit in behavioral phase-resetting to light stimulation in the late night. Here we report rodent stimulus–response characteristics of PACAP release from the RHT, and map these to responses of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in intact and PACAP-deficient mouse hypothalamus with regard to phase-resetting. SCN of PACAP-null mice exhibit normal circadian rhythms in neuronal activity, but are “blind” to glutamate stimulating phase-advance responses in late night, although not in early night, consistent with previously reported selective lack of late-night light behavioral responsiveness of these mice. Induction of CREB phosphorylation, a hallmark of the light/glutamate response of the SCN, also is absent in SCN-containing ex vivo slices from PACAP-deficient mouse hypothalamus. PACAP replacement to the SCN of PACAP-null mice restored wild-type phase-shifting of firing-rate patterns in response to glutamate applied to the SCN in late night. Likewise, ex vivo SCN of wild-type mice post-orbital enucleation are unresponsive to glutamate unless PACAP also is restored. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the period of efficacy of PACAP at SCN nerve terminals corresponds to waxing of PACAP mRNA expression in ipRGCs during the night, and waning during the day. These results validate the use of PACAP-deficient mice in defining the role and specificity of PACAP as a co-transmitter with glutamate in ipRGC-RHT projections to SCN in phase advancing the SCN circadian rhythm in late night.

N2  - Quantitative phase imaging of transparent objects in transmission allows for a direct interpretation of the results: the phase shift measured is linear in the refractive index contrast and object thickness. However, the same measurement in a backscattering geometry yields fundamentally different results, because the incident field component is absent from the detected field. As a result, the relationship between the measured phase and object properties is obscure. We derived analytical expressions for the propagating fields under the first-order Born approximation and studied the interpretation of the measured phase shifts in backscattering versus transmission geometries. Our analysis shows that the backscattering phase shift is the result of the plane wave superposition originating at various depths in the object, which makes it impossible to infer quantitative morphology or topography information of 3D transparent samples from a reflection phase image alone.

N2  - Inspired by the relatively simple morphological blueprint provided by batoid fish such as stingrays and skates, we created a biohybrid system that enables an artificial animal-a tissue-engineered ray-to swim and phototactically follow a light cue. By patterning dissociated rat cardiomyocytes on an elastomeric body enclosing a microfabricated gold skeleton, we replicated fish morphology at 1/10 scale and captured basic fin deflection patterns of batoid fish. Optogenetics allows for phototactic guidance, steering, and turning maneuvers. Optical stimulation induced sequential muscle activation via serpentinepatterned muscle circuits, leading to coordinated undulatory swimming. The speed and direction of the ray was controlled by modulating light frequency and by independently eliciting right and left fins, allowing the biohybrid machine to maneuver through an obstacle course.

N2  - Due to its specificity, fluorescence microscopy has become a quintessential imaging tool in cell biology. However, photobleaching, phototoxicity, and related artifacts continue to limit fluorescence microscopy’s utility. Recently, it has been shown that artificial intelligence (AI) can transform one form of contrast into another. We present phase imaging with computational specificity (PICS), a combination of quantitative phase imaging and AI, which provides information about unlabeled live cells with high specificity. Our imaging system allows for automatic training, while inference is built into the acquisition software and runs in real-time. Applying the computed fluorescence maps back to the quantitative phase imaging (QPI) data, we measured the growth of both nuclei and cytoplasm independently, over many days, without loss of viability. Using a QPI method that suppresses multiple scattering, we measured the dry mass content of individual cell nuclei within spheroids. In its current implementation, PICS offers a versatile quantitative technique for continuous simultaneous monitoring of individual cellular components in biological applications where long-term label-free imaging is desirable.

N2  - Cardiomyocytes are mechanosensitive. In the functioning heart, discrete sets of cardiac oscillators maintain stable relative phase dynamics and mechanical coupling between each other through the elastic tissue. A few questions that remains elusive to date are, how strong is the coupling and how tunable is their dynamics, whether this coupling is phase dependent, and if so, at what phase of cardiac dynamics is the coupling most dominant. In other words, at which phase of its dynamics a cardiac cell is most sensitive to forces and deformations induced by its neighbors. Here we address these questions by culturing rat cardiomyocytes on a stretchable substrate. We apply cyclic stretch on the substrate with a range of frequencies in the vicinity of the intrinsic beating frequency of the cell cluster. We find that the cell cluster can synchronize its dynamics with that of the substrate within 25% of its intrinsic frequency in less than a minute. However, it takes much longer time to return to its intrinsic frequency after removal of substrate stretch. With increasing substrate frequency, the cluster tends to catch up, and beats with a range of frequencies between the intrinsic and the applied with wide variation in relative phases. This allows us to measure phase dependent mechano-sensitivity of the cardiac cluster to the periodic deformation of the substrate that is critical to produce stable relative phase dynamics. We find that cardiac cells are most mechano sensitive when they are at 1/2 of their phase. This phase dependence might be mediated by the ion channels active at this phase of the dynamics. This study identifies a functional output of sub-second scale mechanotransduction with the potential to enhance or reinforce cardiac contractile dynamics.

N2  - We present phase correlation imaging (PCI) as a novel approach to study cell dynamics in a spatially-resolved manner. PCI relies on quantitative phase imaging time-lapse data and, as such, functions in label-free mode, without the limitations associated with exogenous markers. The correlation time map outputted in PCI informs on the dynamics of the intracellular mass transport. Specifically, we show that PCI can extract quantitatively the diffusion coefficient map associated with live cells, as well as standard Brownian particles. Due to its high sensitivity to mass transport, PCI can be applied to studying the integrity of actin polymerization dynamics. Our results indicate that the cyto-D treatment blocking the actin polymerization has a dominant effect at the large spatial scales, in the region surrounding the cell. We found that PCI can distinguish between senescent and quiescent cells, which is extremely difficult without using specific markers currently. We anticipate that PCI will be used alongside established, fluorescence-based techniques to enable valuable new studies of cell function.

N2  - Significant progress has been made towards engineering both single-cell and multi-cellular systems through a combination of synthetic and systems biology, nanobiotechnology, pharmaceutical science, and computational approaches. However, our ability to engineer systems that begin to approach the complexity of natural pathways is severely limited by important challenges, e.g. due to noise, or the fluctuations in gene expression and molecular species at multiple scales (e.g. both intra- and inter-cellular fluctuations). This barrier to engineering requires that biological noise be recognized as a design element with fundamentals that can be actively controlled. Here we highlight studies of an emerging discipline that collectively strives to engineer noise towards predictive stochastic design using interdisciplinary approaches at multiple-scales in diverse living systems.

N2  - Conditions of extended bed rest and limb immobilization can initiate rapid and significant loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. Physical rehabilitation is standard practice following a period of disuse, yet mobility may be severely compromised, and recovery is commonly delayed or incomplete in special populations. Thus, a novel approach toward recovery of muscle mass is highly desired. Pericytes [neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2)+CD31−CD45−(Lineage− [Lin−]) and CD146+Lin−] demonstrate capacity to facilitate muscle repair, yet the ability to enhance myofiber growth following disuse is unknown. In the current study, 3–4-mo-old mice were unilaterally immobilized for 14 d (IM) or immobilized for 14 d followed by 14 d of remobilization (RE). Flow cytometry and targeted gene expression analyses were completed to assess pericyte quantity and function following IM and RE. In addition, a transplantation study was conducted to assess the impact of pericytes on recovery. Results from targeted analyses suggest minimal impact of disuse on pericyte gene expression, yet NG2+Lin− pericyte quantity is reduced following IM (P < 0.05). Remarkably, pericyte transplantation recovered losses in myofiber cross-sectional area and the capillary-to-fiber ratio following RE, whereas deficits remained with vehicle alone (P = 0.01). These findings provide the first evidence that pericytes effectively rehabilitate skeletal muscle mass following disuse atrophy.—Munroe, M., Dvoretskiy, S., Lopez, A., Leong, J., Dyle, M.

N2  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may spread through respiratory droplets released by infected individuals during coughing, sneezing, or speaking. Given the limited supply of professional respirators and face masks, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended home-made cloth face coverings for use by the general public. While there have been several studies on aerosol filtration performance of household fabrics, their effectiveness at blocking larger droplets has not been investigated. Here, we ascertained the performance of 11 common household fabrics at blocking large, high-velocity droplets, using a commercial medical mask as a benchmark. We also assessed the breathability (air permeability), texture, fiber composition, and water absorption properties of the fabrics. We found that most fabrics have substantial blocking efficiency (median values >70%). In particular, two layers of highly permeable fabric, such as T-shirt cloth, blocks droplets with an efficiency (>94%) similar to that of medical masks, while being approximately twice as breathable. The first layer allows about 17% of the droplet volume to transmit, but it significantly reduces their velocity. This allows the second layer to trap the transmitted droplets resulting in high blocking efficacy. Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections. Furthermore, face coverings made from materials such as cotton fabrics allow washing and reusing, and can help reduce the adverse environmental effects of widespread use of commercial disposable and non-biodegradable facemasks.

N2  - There is a close relationship between the mechanical properties of cells and their physiological function. Non-invasive measurements of the physical properties of cells, especially of adherent cells, are challenging to perform. Through a non-contact optical interferometric technique, we measure and combine the phase, amplitude, and frequency of vibrating silicon pedestal micromechanical resonant sensors to quantify the "loss tangent" of individual adherent human colon cancer cells (HT-29). The loss tangent, a dimensionless ratio of viscoelastic energy loss and energy storage - a measure of the viscoelasticity of soft materials, obtained through an optical path length model, was found to be 1.88 ± 0.08 for live cells and 4.32 ± 0.13 for fixed cells, revealing significant changes (p < 0.001) in mechanical properties associated with estimated nanoscale cell membrane fluctuations of 3.86 ± 0.2 nm for live cells and 2.87 ± 0.1 nm for fixed cells. By combining these values with the corresponding two-degree-of-freedom Kelvin-Voigt model, we obtain the elastic stiffness and viscous loss associated with each individual cell rather than estimations from a population. The technique is unique as it decouples the heterogeneity of individual cells in our population and further refines the viscoelastic solution space.

N2  - Complex biological systems sense, process, and respond to their surroundings in real time. The ability of such systems to adapt their behavioral response to suit a range of dynamic environmental signals motivates the use of biological materials for other engineering applications. As a step toward forward engineering biological machines (bio-bots) capable of nonnatural functional behaviors, we created a modular light-controlled skeletal musclepowered bioactuator that can generate up to 300 μN (0.56 kPa) of active tension force in response to a noninvasive optical stimulus. When coupled to a 3D printed flexible bio-bot skeleton, these actuators drive directional locomotion (310 μm/s or 1.3 body lengths/min) and 2D rotational steering (2°/s) in a precisely targeted and controllable manner. The muscle actuators dynamically adapt to their surroundings by adjusting performance in response to "exercise" training stimuli. This demonstration sets the stage for developing multicellular bio-integrated machines and systems for a range of applications.

N2  - Quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystals with bright fluorescence and long-term photostability, attributes particularly beneficial for single-molecule imaging and molecular counting in the life sciences. The size of a QD nanocrystal determines its physicochemical and photophysical properties, both of which dictate the success of imaging applications. Larger nanocrystals typically have better optical properties, with higher brightness, red-shifted emission, reduced blinking, and greater stability. However, larger nanocrystals introduce molecular-labeling biases due to steric hindrance and nonspecific binding. Here, we systematically analyze the impact of nanocrystal size on receptor labeling in live and fixed cells. We designed three (core)shell QDs with red emission (600-700 nm) and crystalline sizes of 3.2, 5.5, and 8.3 nm. After coating with the same multidentate polymer, hydrodynamic sizes were 9.2 nm (QD9.2), 13.3 nm (QD13.3), and 17.4 nm (QD17.4), respectively. The QDs were conjugated to streptavidin and applied as probes for biotinylated neurotransmitter receptors. QD9.2 exhibited the highest labeling specificity for receptors in the narrow synaptic cleft (∼20-30 nm) in living neurons. However, for dense receptor labeling for molecular counting in live and fixed HeLa cells, QD13.3 yielded the highest counts. Nonspecific binding rose sharply for hydrodynamic sizes larger than 13.3 nm, with QD17.4 exhibiting particularly diminished specificity. Our comparisons further highlight needs to continue engineering the smallest QDs to increase single-molecule intensity, suppress blinking frequency, and inhibit nonspecific labeling in fixed and permeabilized cells. These results lay a foundation for designing QD probes with further reduced sizes to achieve unbiased labeling for quantitative and single-molecule imaging.

N2  - The diagnosis of acute kidney disease (AKI) has been examined mainly by histology, immunohistochemistry and western blot. Though these approaches are widely accepted in the field, it has an inherent limitation due to the lack of high-throughput and quantitative information. For a better understanding of prognosis in AKI, we present a new approach using quantitative phase imaging combined with a wide-field scanning platform. Through the phase-delay information from the tissue, we were able to predict a stage of AKI based on various optical properties such as light scattering coefficient and anisotropy. These optical parameters quantify the deterioration process of the AKI model of tissue. Our device would be a very useful tool when it is required to deliver fast feedback of tissue pathology or when diseases are related to mechanical properties such as fibrosis.

N2  - In this paper, we present a novel interpretable machine learning technique that uses unique physical insights about noisy optical images and a few training samples to classify nanoscale defects in noisy optical images of a semiconductor wafer. Using this technique, we not only detected both parallel bridge defects and previously undetectable perpendicular bridge defects in a 9-nm node wafer using visible light microscopy [Proc. SPIE 9424, 942416 (2015)], but we also accurately classified their shapes and estimated their sizes. Detection and classification of nanoscale defects in optical images is a challenging task. The quality of images is affected by diffraction and noise. Machine learning techniques can reduce noise and recognize patterns using a large training set. However, for detecting a rare “killer” defect, acquisition of a sufficient training set of high quality experimental images can be prohibitively expensive. In addition, there are technical challenges involved in using electromagnetic simulations and optimization of the machine learning algorithm. This paper proposes solutions to address each of the aforementioned challenges.

However, detecting the response to the optical stimulation requires electrophysiology with physical contact or fluorescent imaging at target locations, which is often limited by photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this paper, we show that phase imaging can report the intracellular transport induced by optogenetic stimulation. We developed a multimodal instrument that can both stimulate cells with subcellular spatial resolution and detect optical pathlength (OPL) changes with nanometer scale sensitivity. We found that OPL fluctuations following stimulation are consistent with active organelle transport. Furthermore, the results indicate a broadening in the transport velocity distribution, which is significantly higher in stimulated cells compared to optogenetically inactive cells. It is likely that this label-free, contactless measurement of optogenetic response will provide an enabling approach to neuroscience.

N2  - Propidium monoazide (PMA) is a membrane impermeable molecule that covalently bonds to double stranded DNA when exposed to light and inhibits the polymerase activity, thus enabling DNA amplification detection protocols that discriminate between viable and non-viable entities. Here, we present a microfluidic device for inexpensive, fast, and simple PMA labeling for viable qPCR and qLAMP assays. The three labeling stages of mixing, incubation, and cross-linking are completed within a microfluidic device that is designed with Tesla structures for passive microfluidic mixing, bubble trappers to improve flow uniformity, and a blue LED to cross-link the molecules. Our results show that the on-chip PMA labeling is equivalent to the standard manual protocols and prevents the replication of DNA from non-viable cells in amplification assays. However, the on-chip process is faster and simpler (30 min of hands-off work), has a reduced likelihood of false negatives, and it is less expensive because it only uses 1/20th of the reagents normally consumed in standard bench protocols. We used our microfluidic device to perform viable qPCR and qLAMP for the detection of S. typhi and E. coli O157. With this device, we are able to specifically detect viable bacteria, with a limit of detection of 7.6 × 103 and 1.1 × 103 CFU/mL for S. typhi and E. coli O157, respectively, while eliminating amplification from non-viable cells. Furthermore, we studied the effects of greater flow rates to expedite the labeling process and identified a maximum flow rate of 0.7 μL/min for complete labeling with the current design.

N2  - When nanoparticles encounter a biological fluid, proteins, lipids, and other biomolecules adsorb on the nanoscale surface consequently leading to the evolution of a protein shell or “corona.” The corona formed is dynamic in nature and depends on the “synthetic identity” of the NPs, ultimately affecting their biological response. In this paper, an integrated microfluidic platform coupled with an electrical resistance measurement setup is developed to monitor and investigate the real-time formation of a biomolecular corona of carbon nanoparticles. “Soft” and “hard” corona formation stages are effectively discriminated based on their nanoscale surface chemistries when combined with a time-frequency tool known as wavelet transform and machine-learning techniques. Additionally, the corona and its composition are studied using different techniques such as dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, zeta potential, excitation–emission profiles, 1D sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The dynamic setup can eventually be used as a valuable tool for screening of any nanoparticles formulations with distinct surface chemistries for the purpose of reduced protein adsorption/weaker protein corona formation and consequently enhance the success of targeted drug delivery.

N2  - The use of field effect transistors (FETs) as the transduction element for the detection of DNA amplification reactions will enable portable and inexpensive nucleic acid analysis. Transistors used as biological sensors, or BioFETs, minimize the cost and size of detection platforms by leveraging fabrication methods already well developed for electronics. Here, we report a dual-gate BioFET (DG-BioFET) array platform with 1024×1024 sensors that is used for on-chip electrical detection of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reactions that target food borne bacterial pathogens. The DG-BioFETs of our 7 × 7 mm2 array are able to electrically detect pH changes that are triggered by nucleotide incorporation during LAMP elongation. Multiple 250 nL reactions can be simultaneously electrically monitored in our array that is divided in 30 micro-chambers with gold-coated anisotropically etched silicon wells that act both as reference electrode and confinement element. Our characterization results show that the gold-biased DG-BioFETs have a sensitivity of 32 mV pH-1 (equivalent to 2 μA pH-1) and an average resolution of 0.5 pH units. This sensitivity is high enough to detect the pH changes triggered by the amplification reaction, but to maximize our signal-to-noise ratio and improve our quantitative conclusions we use a group of data analysis techniques that are available in our high-density platform that monitors each reaction with ∼3500 independent BioFETs. We use redundancy techniques to minimize the overall standard deviation of our measurements, the Grubbs test to eliminate measurements outside the expected normal distribution, and reference micro-chambers to subtract the common noise. With these techniques we are capable of reducing the P value, of a t-test comparing positive and negative readings, from a typical 0.17 to 0.03. The platform that we present along with the analysis techniques that we developed allow the on-chip electrical detection and identification of E. coli O157 and S. typhi with parallel LAMP assays targeting eae and invA genes. The LAMP reactions are highly specific, without false positives, and our titration assays demonstrate a limit of detection of 23 CFU per reaction on chip.

N2  - The emergence and understanding of new design principles that exploit flow-induced mechanical instabilities for propulsion require robust and accurate flow-structure interaction numerical models. In this contribution, we report the development of an algorithm that combines Vortex Particles Mesh (VPM) method and Multi-Body System (MBS) solver for the simulation of actuated swimming structures in fluids. The hydrodynamic efforts are recovered through an innovative approach based on the penalization and projection steps performed within the VPM method. The resulting method avoids time consuming computation of the stresses at the wall to recover the force distribution on the surface of complex deforming shapes. This feature crucially distinguish the proposed approach from other VPM formulations and opens the door for the development of control frameworks for bio-inspired and autonomous robotic swimmers. As a first illustration towards this goal, this paper reports a swimming agent stabilizing its gait in the wake of a cylinder. Illustrating the dynamic features of our framework, we report the energy saved by swimming behind this cylinder as compared to a stationary gait in an induced flow. We also compared this result to the energy saved by following the wake of a moving cylinder.

N2  - The integration of muscle cells with soft robotics in recent years has led to the development of biohybrid machines capable of untethered locomotion. A major frontier that currently remains unexplored is neuronal actuation and control of such muscle-powered biohybrid machines. As a step toward this goal, we present here a biohybrid swimmer driven by on-board neuromuscular units. The body of the swimmer consists of a free-standing soft scaffold, skeletal muscle tissue, and optogenetic stem cell-derived neural cluster containing motor neurons. Myoblasts embedded in extracellular matrix self-organize into a muscle tissue guided by the geometry of the scaffold, and the resulting muscle tissue is cocultured in situ with a neural cluster. Motor neurons then extend neurites selectively toward the muscle and innervate it, developing functional neuromuscular units. Based on this initial construct, we computationally designed, optimized, and implemented light-sensitive flagellar swimmers actuated by these neuromuscular units. Cyclic muscle contractions, induced by neural stimulation, drive time-irreversible flagellar dynamics, thereby providing thrust for untethered forward locomotion of the swimmer. Overall, this work demonstrates an example of a biohybrid robot implementing neuromuscular actuation and illustrates a path toward the forward design and control of neuron-enabled biohybrid machines.

N2  - Understanding the mechanisms by which neurons create or suppress connections to enable communication in brain-derived neuronal cultures can inform how learning, cognition and creative behavior emerge. While prior studies have shown that neuronal cultures possess self-organizing criticality properties, we further demonstrate that in vitro brain-derived neuronal cultures exhibit a self-optimization phenomenon. More precisely, we analyze the multiscale neural growth data obtained from label-free quantitative microscopic imaging experiments and reconstruct the in vitro neuronal culture networks (microscale) and neuronal culture cluster networks (mesoscale). We investigate the structure and evolution of neuronal culture networks and neuronal culture cluster networks by estimating the importance of each network node and their information flow. By analyzing the degree-, closeness-, and betweenness-centrality, the node-to-node degree distribution (informing on neuronal interconnection phenomena), the clustering coefficient/transitivity (assessing the "small-world" properties), and the multifractal spectrum, we demonstrate that murine neurons exhibit self-optimizing behavior over time with topological characteristics distinct from existing complex network models. The time-evolving interconnection among murine neurons optimizes the network information flow, network robustness, and self-organization degree. These findings have complex implications for modeling neuronal cultures and potentially on how to design biological inspired artificial intelligence.

N2  - Sepsis, as a leading cause of death worldwide, relies on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria for its diagnosis. SIRS is highly non-specific as it relies on monitoring of patients' vitals for sepsis diagnosis, which are known to change with many confounding factors. Changes in leukocyte counts and CD64 expression levels are known specific biomarkers of pro-inflammatory host response at the onset of sepsis. Recently, we have developed a biosensor chip that can enumerate the leukocyte counts and quantify the neutrophil CD64 expression levels from a drop of blood. We were able to show improved sepsis diagnosis and prognosis in clinical studies by measuring these parameters during different times of the patients' stay in hospital. In this paper, we investigated the rate of cell capture with CD64 expression levels and used this in a multivariate computational model using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and showed improved accuracy of quantifying CD64 expression levels from the biosensor (n = 106 whole blood experiments). We found a high coefficient of determination and low error between biosensor- and flow cytometry-based neutrophil CD64 expression levels using multiple ANN training methods in comparison to those of univariate regression commonly employed. This approach can find many applications in biosensor data analytics by utilizing multiple features of the biosensor's data for output determination.

N2  - New tools are needed to enable rapid detection, identification, and reporting of infectious viral and microbial pathogens in a wide variety of point-of-care applications that impact human and animal health. We report the design, construction, and characterization of a platform for multiplexed analysis of disease-specific DNA sequences that utilizes a smartphone camera as the sensor in conjunction with a handheld instrument that interfaces the phone with a silicon-based microfluidic chip. Utilizing specific nucleic acid sequences for four equine respiratory pathogens as representative examples, we demonstrated the ability of the system to use a single 15-μL droplet of test sample to perform selective positive/negative determination of target sequences, including integrated experimental controls, in approximately 30 minutes. The system achieves detection limits comparable to those obtained by laboratory-based methods and instruments.

N2  - The brain functions through chemical interactions between many different cell types, including neurons and glia. Acquiring comprehensive information on complex, heterogeneous systems requires multiple analytical tools, each of which have unique chemical specificity and spatial resolution. Multimodal imaging generates complementary chemical information via spatially localized molecular maps, ideally from the same sample, but requires method enhancements that span from data acquisition to interpretation. We devised a protocol for performing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), followed by infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging on the same specimen. Multimodal measurements from the same tissue provide precise spatial alignment between modalities, enabling more advanced image processing such as image fusion and sharpening. Performing MSI first produces higher quality data from each technique compared to performing IR imaging before MSI. The difference is likely due to fixing the tissue section during MALDI matrix removal, thereby preventing analyte degradation occurring during IR imaging from an unfixed specimen. Leveraging the unique capabilities of each modality, we utilized pan sharpening of MS (mass spectrometry) ion images with selected bands from IR spectroscopy and midlevel data fusion. In comparison to sharpening with histological images, pan sharpening can employ a plethora of IR bands, producing sharpened MS images while retaining the fidelity of the initial ion images. Using Laplacian pyramid sharpening, we determine the localization of several lipids present within the hippocampus with high mass accuracy at 5 μm pixel widths. Further, through midlevel data fusion of the imaging data sets combined with k-means clustering, the combined data set discriminates between additional anatomical structures unrecognized by the individual imaging approaches. Significant differences between molecular ion abundances are detected between relevant structures within the hippocampus, such as the CA1 and CA3 regions. Our methodology provides high quality multiplex and multimodal chemical imaging of the same tissue sample, enabling more advanced data processing and analysis routines.

N2  - Ranging from miniaturized biological robots to organoids, multi-cellular engineered living systems (M-CELS) pose complex ethical and societal challenges. Some of these challenges, such as how to best distribute risks and benefits, are likely to arise in the development of any new technology. Other challenges arise specifically because of the particular characteristics of M-CELS. For example, as an engineered living system becomes increasingly complex, it may provoke societal debate about its moral considerability, perhaps necessitating protection from harm or recognition of positive moral and legal rights, particularly if derived from cells of human origin. The use of emergence-based principles in M-CELS development may also create unique challenges, making the technology difficult to fully control or predict in the laboratory as well as in applied medical or environmental settings. In response to these challenges, we argue that the M-CELS community has an obligation to systematically address the ethical and societal aspects of research and to seek input from and accountability to a broad range of stakeholders and publics. As a newly developing field, M-CELS has a significant opportunity to integrate ethically responsible norms and standards into its research and development practices from the start. With the aim of seizing this opportunity, we identify two general kinds of salient ethical issues arising from M-CELS research, and then present a set of commitments to and strategies for addressing these issues. If adopted, these commitments and strategies would help define M-CELS as not only an innovative field, but also as a model for responsible research and engineering.

N2  - The goal of this study was to characterize sperm populations resulting from three different methods of sperm selection used for bovine in vitro fertilization. We compared sperm selection with discontinuous Percoll gradients, Swim-Up, and electro-channel. Spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) was used to evaluate the morphology of the spermatozoa and computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) was used to evaluate the motility behavior of the sperm. Using these two technologies, we analyzed morphometric parameters and the kinetic (motility) patterns of frozen-thawed Holstein bull spermatozoa after sperm selection. For the first time, we have shown that these methods used to select viable spermatozoa for in vitro fertilization (IVF) result in very different sperm subpopulations. Almost every parameter evaluated resulted in statistical differences between treatment groups. One novel observation was that the dry mass of the sperm head is heavier in spermatozoa selected with the electro-channel than in sperm selected by the other methods. These results show the potential of SLIM microscopy in reproductive biology.

Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of monolayer MoS                             2                              nanoribbon field-effect transistors as narrow as 30 nm using scanning probe lithography (SPL). The SPL process uses a heated nanometer-scale tip to deposit narrow nanoribbon polymer structures onto monolayer MoS                             2                             . The polymer serves as an etch mask during a XeF                             2                              vapor etch, which defines the channel of a field-effect transistor (FET). We fabricated seven devices with a channel width ranging from 30 to 370 nm, and the fabrication process was carefully studied by electronic measurements made at each process step. The nanoribbon devices have a current on/off ratio > 10                             4                              and an extrinsic field-effect mobility up to 8.53 cm                             2                             /(V s). By comparing a 30 nm wide device with a 60 nm wide device that was fabricated on the same MoS                             2                              flake, we found the narrower device had a smaller mobility, a lower on/off ratio, and a larger subthreshold swing. To our knowledge, this is the first published work that describes a working transistor device from monolayer MoS                             2                              with a channel width smaller than 100 nm.

N2  - In the past several decades, significant efforts have been devoted to recapitulating the in vivo tissue microenvironment within an in vitro platform. However, it is still challenging to recreate de novo tissue with physiologically relevant matrix properties and fluid flow. To this end, this study demonstrates a method to independently tailor matrix stiffness and interstitial fluid flow using a cell-microenvironment-on-a-chip (C-MOC) platform. Collagen-polyethylene glycol gels tailored to present controlled stiffness and hydraulic conductivity were fabricated in a microfluidic chip. The chip was assembled to continuously create a steady flow of media through the gel. In the C-MOC platform, interstitial flow mitigated the effects of matrix softness on breast cancer cell behavior, according to an immunostaining-based analysis of estrogen receptor-α (ER-α), integrin β1, and E-cadherin. This advanced cell culture platform serves to engineer tissue similar to in vitro tissue and contribute to better understanding and regulating of the biological roles of extracellular microenvironments.

N2  - Control of electrical activity in neural circuits through network training is a grand challenge for biomedicine and engineering applications. Past efforts have not considered evoking long-term changes in firing patterns of in-vitro networks by introducing training regimens with respect to stages of neural development. Here, we used Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) transfected mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) derived motor neurons to explore short and long-term programming of neural networks by using optical stimulation implemented during neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Not only did we see a subsequent increase of neurite extensions and synaptophysin clustering, but by using electrophysiological recording with micro electrode arrays (MEA) we also observed changes in signal frequency spectra, increase of network synchrony, coordinated firing of actions potentials, and enhanced evoked response to stimulation during network formation. Our results demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation during neural differentiation can result in permanent changes that extended to the genetic expression of neurons as demonstrated by RNA Sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a correlation between training regimens during neurogenesis and synaptogenesis and the resulting plastic responses has been shown in-vitro and traced back to changes in gene expression. This work demonstrates new approaches for training of neural circuits whose electrical activity can be modulated and enhanced, which could lead to improvements in neurodegenerative disease research and engineering of in-vitro multi-cellular living systems.

N2  - Natural creatures, from fish and cephalopods to snakes and birds, combine neural control, sensory feedback and compliant mechanics to effectively operate across dynamic, uncertain environments. In order to facilitate the understanding of the biophysical mechanisms at play and to streamline their potential use in engineering applications, we present here a versatile numerical approach to the simulation of musculoskeletal architectures. It relies on the assembly of heterogenous, active and passive Cosserat rods into dynamic structures that model bones, tendons, ligaments, fibers and muscle connectivity. We demonstrate its utility in a range of problems involving biological and soft robotic scenarios across scales and environments: from the engineering of millimeter-long bio-hybrid robots to the synthesis and reconstruction of complex musculoskeletal systems. The versatility of this methodology offers a framework to aid forward and inverse bioengineering designs as well as fundamental discovery in the functioning of living organisms.

N2  - The large-scale conformation of DNA molecules plays a critical role in many basic elements of cellular functionality and viability. By targeting the structural properties of DNA, many cancer drugs, such as anthracyclines, effectively inhibit tumor growth but can also produce dangerous side effects. To enhance the development of innovative medications, rapid screening of structural changes to DNA can provide important insight into their mechanism of interaction. In this study, we report changes to circular DNA conformation from intercalation with ethidium bromide using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and characterized experimentally by translocation through a silicon nitride solid-state nanopore. Our measurements reveal three distinct current blockade levels and a 6-fold increase in translocation times for ethidium bromide-treated circular DNA as compared to untreated circular DNA. We attribute these increases to changes in the supercoiled configuration hypothesized to be branched or looped structures formed in the circular DNA molecule. Further evidence of the conformational changes is demonstrated by qualitative atomic force microscopy analysis. These results expand the current methodology for predicting and characterizing DNA tertiary structure and advance nanopore technology as a platform for deciphering structural changes of other important biomolecules.

N2  - New tools are needed to enable rapid detection, identification, and reporting of infectious viral and microbial pathogens in a wide variety of point-of-care applications that impact human and animal health. We report the design, construction, and characterization of a platform for multiplexed analysis of disease-specific DNA sequences that utilizes a smartphone camera as the sensor in conjunction with a hand-held "cradle" that interfaces the phone with a silicon-based microfluidic chip embedded within a credit-card-sized cartridge. Utilizing specific nucleic acid sequences for four equine respiratory pathogens as representative examples, we demonstrated the ability of the system to utilize a single 15 μL droplet of test sample to perform selective positive/negative determination of target sequences, including integrated experimental controls, in approximately 30 min. Our approach utilizes loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reagents predeposited into distinct lanes of the microfluidic chip, which when exposed to target nucleic acid sequences from the test sample, generates fluorescent products that when excited by appropriately selected light emitting diodes (LEDs), are visualized and automatically analyzed by a software application running on the smartphone microprocessor. The system achieves detection limits comparable to those obtained by laboratory-based methods and instruments. Assay information is combined with the information from the cartridge and the patient to populate a cloud-based database for epidemiological reporting of test results.

N2  - Enumerating specific cell types from whole blood can be very useful for research and diagnostic purposes - e.g., for counting of CD4 and CD8 T cells in HIV/AIDS diagnostics. We have developed a biosensor based on a differential immunocapture technology to enumerate specific cells in 30 min using 10 μl of blood. This paper provides a comprehensive stepwise protocol to replicate our biosensor for CD4 and CD8 cell counts. The biochip can also be adapted to enumerate other specific cell types such as somatic cells or cells from tissue or liquid biopsies. Capture of other specific cells requires immobilization of their corresponding antibodies within the capture chamber. Therefore, this protocol is useful for research into areas surrounding immunocapture-based biosensor development. The biosensor production requires 24 h, a one-time cell capture optimization takes 6-9 h, and the final cell counting experiment in a laboratory environment requires 30 min to complete.

N2  - Melatonin is released from the pineal gland into the circulatory system at night in the absence of light, acting as "hormone of darkness" to the brain and body. Melatonin also can regulate circadian phasing of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). During the day-to-night transition, melatonin exposure advances intrinsic SCN neural activity rhythms via the melatonin type-2 (MT2 ) receptor and downstream activation of protein kinase C (PKC). The effects of melatonin on SCN phasing have not been linked to daily changes in the expression of core genes that constitute the molecular framework of the circadian clock. Using real-time RT-PCR, we found that melatonin induces an increase in the expression of two clock genes, Period 1 (Per1) and Period 2 (Per2). This effect occurs at CT 10, when melatonin advances SCN phase, but not at CT 6, when it does not. Using anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotides (α ODNs) to Per 1 and Per 2, as well as to E-box enhancer sequences in the promoters of these genes, we show that their specific induction is necessary for the phasealtering effects of melatonin on SCN neural activity rhythms in the rat. These effects of melatonin on Per1 and Per2 were mediated by PKC. This is unlike day-active non-photic signals that reset the SCN clock by non-PCK signal transduction mechanisms and by decreasing Per1 expression. Rather, this finding extends roles for Per1 and Per2, which are critical to photic phase-resetting, to a nonphotic zeitgeber, melatonin, and suggest that the regulation of these clock gene transcripts is required for clock resetting by diverse regulatory cues.

N2  - Several in vitro and limited in vivo experiments have shown that neurons maintain a rest tension along their axons intrinsically. They grow in response to stretch but contract in response to loss of tension. This contraction eventually leads to the restoration of the rest tension in axons. However, the mechanism by which axons maintain tension in vivo remains elusive. The objective of this work is to elucidate the key cytoskeletal components responsible for generating tension in axons. Toward this goal, in vivo experiments were conducted on single axons of embryonic Drosophila motor neurons in the presence of various drugs. Each axon was slackened mechanically by bringing the neuromuscular junction toward the central nervous system multiple times. In the absence of any drug, axons shortened and restored the straight configuration within 2–4 min of slackening. The total shortening was ∼40% of the original length. The recovery rate in each cycle, but not the recovery magnitude, was dependent on the axon's prior contraction history. For example, the contraction time of a previously slackened axon may be twice its first-time contraction. This recovery was significantly hampered with the depletion of ATP, inhibition of myosin motors, and disruption of actin filaments. The disruption of microtubules did not affect the recovery magnitude, but, on the contrary, led to an enhanced recovery rate compared to control cases. These results suggest that the actomyosin machinery is the major active element in axonal contraction, whereas microtubules contribute as resistive/dissipative elements.

Toward this goal, in vivo experiments were conducted on single axons of embryonic Drosophila motor neurons in the presence of various drugs. Each axon was slackened mechanically by bringing the neuromuscular junction toward the central nervous system multiple times. In the absence of any drug, axons shortened and restored the straight configuration within 2–4 min of slackening. The total shortening was ∼40% of the original length. The recovery rate in each cycle, but not the recovery magnitude, was dependent on the axon's prior contraction history. For example, the contraction time of a previously slackened axon may be twice its first-time contraction. This recovery was significantly hampered with the depletion of ATP, inhibition of myosin motors, and disruption of actin filaments. The disruption of microtubules did not affect the recovery magnitude, but, on the contrary, led to an enhanced recovery rate compared to control cases. These results suggest that the actomyosin machinery is the major active element in axonal contraction, whereas microtubules contribute as resistive/dissipative elements.

N2  - Systems of randomly packed, macroscopic elements, from jammed spherical grains to tangled long filaments, represent a broad class of disordered meta-materials with a wide range of applications and manifestations in nature. A "bird nest" presents itself at an interface between hard round grains described by granular physics to long soft filaments, the center of textile material science. All of these randomly packed systems exhibit forms of self-assembly, evident through their robust packing statistics, and share a common elastoplastic response to oedometric compression. In reviewing packing statistics, mechanical response characterization, and consideration of boundary effects, we present a perspective that attempts to establish a link between the bulk and local behavior of a pile of sand and a wad of cotton, demonstrating the nest's relationship with each. Finally, potential directions for impactful applications are outlined.

N2  - We present the scattering properties of mouse brain using multispectral diffraction phase microscopy. Typical diffraction phase microscopy was incorporated with the broadband light source which offers the measurement of the scattering coefficient and anisotropy in the spectral range of 550-900 nm. The regional analysis was performed for both the myeloarchitecture and cytoarchitecture of the brain tissue. Our results clearly evaluate the multispectral scattering properties in the olfactory bulb and corpus callosum. The scattering coefficient measured in the corpus callosum is about four times higher than in the olfactory bulb. It also indicates that it is feasible to realize the quantitative phase microscope in near infrared region for thick brain tissue imaging.

N2  - Activating Group 1 (Gp1) metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including mGluR1 and mGluR5, elicits translationdependent neural plasticity mechanisms that are crucial to animal behavior and circuit development. Dysregulated Gp1 mGluR signaling has been observed in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the molecular pathways underlying Gp1 mGluR-dependent plasticity mechanisms are complex and have been elusive. In this study, we identified a novel mechanism through which Gp1 mGluR mediates protein translation and neural plasticity. Using a multi-electrode array (MEA) recording system, we showed that activating Gp1 mGluR elevates neural network activity, as demonstrated by increased spontaneous spike frequency and burst activity. Importantly, we validated that elevating neural network activity requires protein translation and is dependent on fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the protein that is deficient in the most common inherited form of mental retardation and autism, fragile X syndrome (FXS). In an effort to determine the mechanism by which FMRP mediates protein translation and neural network activity, we demonstrated that a ubiquitin E3 ligase, murine double minute-2 (Mdm2), is required for Gp1 mGluR-induced translation and neural network activity. Our data showed that Mdm2 acts as a translation suppressor, and FMRP is required for its ubiquitination and down-regulation upon Gp1 mGluR activation. These data revealed a novel mechanism by which Gp1 mGluR and FMRP mediate protein translation and neural network activity, potentially through de-repressing Mdm2. Our results also introduce an alternative way for understanding altered protein translation and brain circuit excitability associated with Gp1 mGluR in neurological diseases such as FXS.

N2  - Recreation of a muscle that can be controlled by the nervous system would provide a major breakthrough for treatments of injury and diseases. However, the underlying basis of how neuron–muscle interfaces are formed is still not understood sufficiently. Here, it is hypothesized that substrate topography regulates neural innervation and synaptic transmission by mediating the cross-talk between neurons and muscles. This hypothesis is examined by differentiating neural stem cells on the myotubes, formed on the substrate with controlled groove width. The substrate with the groove width of 1600 nm, a similar size to the myofibril diameter, serves to produce larger and aligned myotubes than the flat substrate. The myotubes formed on the grooved substrate display increases in the acetylcholine receptor expression. Reciprocally, motor neuron progenitor cells differentiated from neural stem cells innervate the larger and aligned myotubes more actively than randomly oriented myotubes. As a consequence, mature and aligned myotubes respond to glutamate (i.e., an excitatory neurotransmitter) and curare (i.e., a neuromuscular antagonist) more rapidly and homogeneously than randomly oriented myotubes. The results of this study will be broadly useful for improving the quality of engineered muscle used in a series of applications including drug screening, regeneration therapies, and biological machinery assembly.

N2  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) include synthetic compounds that mimic the structure or function of natural hormones. While most studies utilize live embryos or primary cells from adult fish, these cells rapidly lose functionality when cultured on plastic or glass substrates coated with extracellular matrix proteins. This study hypothesizes that the softness of a matrix with adhered fish cells can regulate the intercellular organization and physiological function of engineered hepatoids during EDC exposure. We scrutinized this hypothesis by culturing zebrafish hepatocytes (ZF-L) on collagen-based hydrogels with controlled elastic moduli by examining morphology, urea production, and intracellular oxidative stress of hepatoids exposed to 17β-estradiol. Interestingly, the softer gel drove cells to form a cell sheet with a canaliculi-like structure compared to its stiffer gel counterpart. The hepatoids cultured on the softer gel exhibited more active urea production upon exposure to 17β-estradiol and displayed faster recovery of intracellular reactive oxygen species level confirmed by gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM), a live-cell imaging technique. These results are broadly useful to improve screening and understanding of potential EDC impacts on aquatic organisms and human health.

N2  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into multiple lineages through guidance from the biophysical and biochemical properties of the extracellular matrix. In this work we conduct a combinatorial study of matrix properties that influence adipogenesis and neurogenesis including: adhesion proteins, stiffness, and cell geometry, for mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (AT-MSCs) and bone marrow (BM-MSCs). We uncover distinct differences in integrin expression, the magnitude of traction stress, and lineage specification to adipocytes and neuron-like cells between cell sources. In the absence of media supplements, adipogenesis in AT-MSCs is not significantly influenced by matrix properties, while the converse is true in BM-MSCs. Both cell types show changes in the expression of neurogenesis markers as matrix cues are varied. When cultured on laminin conjugated microislands of the same adhesive area, BM-MSCs display elevated adipogenesis markers, while AT-MSCs display elevated neurogenesis markers; integrin analysis suggests neurogenesis in AT-MSCs is guided by adhesion through integrin αvβ3. Overall, the properties of the extracellular matrix guides MSC adhesion and lineage specification to different degrees and outcomes, in spite of their similarities in general characteristics. This work will help guide the selection of MSCs and matrix components for applications where high fidelity of differentiation outcome is desired. Statement of Significance Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell type for stem cell therapies; however, in order for these cells to be useful in medicine, we need to understand how they respond to the physical and chemical environments of tissue. Here, we explore how two promising sources of MSCs—those derived from bone marrow and from adipose tissue—respond to the compliance and composition of tissue using model extracellular matrices. Our results demonstrate a source-specific propensity to undergo adipogenesis and neurogenesis, and uncover a role for adhesion, and the degree of traction force exerted on the substrate in guiding these lineage outcomes.

N2  - Label-free imaging of rapidly moving, sub-diffraction sized structures has important applications in both biology and material science, as it removes the limitations associated with fluorescence tagging. However, unlabeled nanoscale particles in suspension are difficult to image due to their transparency and fast Brownian motion. Here we describe a novel interferometric imaging technique referred to as Magnified Image Spatial Spectrum (MISS) microscopy, which overcomes these challenges. The MISS microscope provides quantitative phase information and enables dynamic light scattering investigations with an overall optical path length sensitivity of 0.95 nm at 833 frames per second acquisition rate. Using spatiotemporal filtering, we find that the sensitivity can be further pushed down to 10−3-10−2 nm. We demonstrate the instrument’s capability through colloidal nanoparticle sizing down to 20 nm diameter and measurements of live neuron membrane dynamics. MISS microscopy is implemented as an upgrade module to an existing microscope, which converts it into a powerful light scattering instrument. Thus, we anticipate that MISS will be adopted broadly for both material and life sciences applications.

N2  - Nucleic acids serve as biomarkers of disease and it is highly desirable to develop approaches to extract small number of such genomic extracts from human bodily fluids. Magnetic particles-based nucleic acid extraction is widely used for concentration of small amount of samples and is followed by DNA amplification in specific assays. However, approaches to integrate such magnetic particles based capture with micro and nanofluidic based assays are still lacking. In this report, we demonstrate a magnetophoretic-based approach for target-specific DNA extraction and concentration within a microfluidic device. This device features a large chamber for reducing flow velocity and an array of μ-magnets for enhancing magnetic flux density. With this strategy, the device is able to collect up to 95 % of the magnetic particles from the fluidic flow and to concentrate these magnetic particles in a collection region. Then an enzymatic reaction is used to detach the DNA from the magnetic particles within the microfluidic device, making the DNA available for subsequent analysis. Concentrations of over 1000-fold for 90 bp dsDNA molecules is demonstrated. This strategy can bridge the gap between detection of low concentration analytes from clinical samples and a range of micro and nanofluidic sensors and devices including nanopores, nano-cantilevers, and nanowires.

N2  - Synaptic scaling allows neurons to homeostatically readjust synaptic strength upon chronic neural activity perturbations. Although altered synaptic scaling has been implicated to underlie imbalanced brain excitability in neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy, the molecular dysregulation and restoration of synaptic scaling in those diseases have not been demonstrated. Here, we showed that the homeostatic synaptic downscaling is absent in the hippocampal neurons of Fmr1 KO mice, the mouse model of the most common inherited autism, fragile X syndrome (FXS). We found that the impaired homeostatic synaptic downscaling in Fmr1 KO neurons is caused by loss-of-function dephosphorylation of an epilepsy-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-2, Nedd4-2. Such dephosphorylation of Nedd4-2 is surprisingly caused by abnormally stable tumor suppressor p53 and subsequently destabilized kinase Akt. Dephosphorylated Nedd4-2 fails to elicit 14-3-3-dependent ubiquitination and down-regulation of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptor, and therefore impairs synaptic downscaling. Most importantly, using a pharmacological inhibitor of p53, Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, GluA1 ubiquitination and synaptic downscaling are all restored in Fmr1 KO neurons. Together, our results discover a novel cellular mechanism underlying synaptic downscaling, and demonstrate the dysregulation and successful restoration of this mechanism in the FXS mouse model.

N2  - Tissue-engineered skeletal muscle plays an important role not only in the field of regenerative medicine but also in emerging areas such as soft robotics, organ-on-a-chip disease models, and drug testing. However, further expansion of the applications of tissue-engineered skeletal muscle models requires a suitable method for their long-term storage and shipment. Cryopreservation has long been the standard for cell storage, but the freezing of three-dimensional tissues is accompanied by many complications due to heat and mass transfer limitations. In this study, we used a tissue-engineered skeletal muscle bioactuator as a model to characterize the effects of freezing on muscle viability, gene expression, myotube structure, and force generation. We optimized the protocol for cryopreservation by comparing outcomes when tissue was frozen undifferentiated and differentiated. Our optimized protocol, in which skeletal muscle was frozen undifferentiated, not only maintained cell viability but also led to a three-fold increase in force production compared to unfrozen muscle. Furthermore, we enhanced muscle lifetime through inhibition of cysteine proteases. The reported timeline for skeletal muscle tissue fabrication, freezing, revival, and long-term culture not only promotes a more streamlined fabrication process but also enables multisite collaborative research efforts through the shipment of preformed skeletal muscle constructs. The ability to freeze, revive, and prolong the lifetime of tissue-engineered skeletal muscle without incurring any loss of function represents a significant advancement in the field of tissue engineering. Cryopreservation enables the efficient fabrication, storage, and shipment of these tissues. This in turn facilitates multidisciplinary collaboration between research groups, enabling advances in skeletal muscle regenerative medicine, organ-on-a-chip models of disease, drug testing, and soft robotics. Furthermore, the observation that freezing undifferentiated skeletal muscle enhances functional performance may motivate future studies developing stronger and more clinically relevant engineered muscle.

N2  - Temperature increases during dielectrophoresis (DEP) can affect the response of biological entities, and ignoring the effect can result in misleading analysis. The heating mechanism of a DEP device is typically considered to be the result of Joule heating and is overlooked without an appropriate analysis. Our experiment and analysis indicate that the heating mechanism is due to the dielectric loss (Debye relaxation). A temperature increase between interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) has been measured with an integrated micro temperature sensor between IDEs to be as high as 70 °C at 1.5 MHz with a 30 Vpp applied voltage to our ultra-low thermal mass DEP device. Analytical and numerical analysis of the power dissipation due to the dielectric loss are in good agreement with the experiment data.

N2  - Exposure to fluorescent excitation light is known to adversely affect living cells. Here, we provide experimental evidence showing fibroblast cells relax abruptly during illumination with fluorescent excitation light. Cells were plated on polyacrylamide (PA) gels embedded with fluorescent microbeads. The beads served as fiducial markers to track substrate displacements induced by cell force. When the cells adhere, they apply traction forces to their underlying surface, causing the substrate to contract inward with respect to the cell boundary. We find that contractile cell forces are sporadically interrupted by abrupt force relaxation events, characterized by outward “jumps” in displacement (⩾ 30 nm in 0.5 s) of the underlying substrate during exposure to fluorescent light. Jumps occur more frequently on softer substrates. Additionally, the speed and direction of displacements of particles before and after jumps are conserved, suggesting that the jumps do not involve any change in cytoskeletal or adhesion structure of the cell, and are possibly mediated by disengagement and re-engagement of myosin motors with actin filaments. Interestingly, we find that the frequency of jumps is also modulated by the energy introduced by the excitation light source. We propose a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the observations.

N2  - Schooling, an archetype of collective behaviour, emerges from the interactions of fish responding to sensory information mediated by their aqueous environment. A fundamental and largely unexplored question in fish schooling concerns the role of hydrodynamics. Here, we investigate this question by modelling swimmers as vortex dipoles whose interactions are governed by the Biot-Savart law. When we enhance these dipoles with behavioural rules from classical agent-based models, we find that they do not lead robustly to schooling because of flow-mediated interactions. We therefore propose to use swimmers equipped with adaptive decision-making that adjust their gaits through a reinforcement learning algorithm in response to nonlinearly varying hydrodynamic loads. We demonstrate that these swimmers can maintain their relative position within a formation by adapting their strength and school in a variety of prescribed geometrical arrangements. Furthermore, we identify schooling patterns that minimize the individual and collective swimming effort, through an evolutionary optimization. The present work suggests that the adaptive response of individual swimmers to flow-mediated interactions is critical in fish schooling.

N2  - Many specimens of interest, embryos, brain slices, organoids, are thick and optically inhomogeneous, which results in strong multiple scattering and low-contrast imaging. We developed GLIM as a novel label-free imaging method with applicability from nanoscale topographic structures to 2-300-micron thick tissues. Due to its interferometric principle that maintains equal power in the two interfering fields, GLIM is able to reject much of the multiple scattering background and generate high contrast interference. We present its principle and illustrate the performance with imaging nano pillars, cells, and embryos.

N2  - The current practice of surgical pathology relies on external contrast agents to reveal tissue architecture, which is then qualitatively examined by a trained pathologist. The diagnosis is based on the comparison with standardized empirical, qualitative assessments of limited objectivity. We propose an approach to pathology based on interferometric imaging of "unstained" biopsies, which provides unique capabilities for quantitative diagnosis and automation. We developed a label-free tissue scanner based on "quantitative phase imaging," which maps out optical path length at each point in the field of view and, thus, yields images that are sensitive to the "nanoscale" tissue architecture. Unlike analysis of stained tissue, which is qualitative in nature and affected by color balance, staining strength and imaging conditions, optical path length measurements are intrinsically quantitative, i.e., images can be compared across different instruments and clinical sites. These critical features allow us to automate the diagnosis process. We paired our interferometric optical system with highly parallelized, dedicated software algorithms for data acquisition, allowing us to image at a throughput comparable to that of commercial tissue scanners while maintaining the nanoscale sensitivity to morphology. Based on the measured phase information, we implemented software tools for autofocusing during imaging, as well as image archiving and data access. To illustrate the potential of our technology for large volume pathology screening, we established an "intrinsic marker" for colorectal disease that detects tissue with dysplasia or colorectal cancer and flags specific areas for further examination, potentially improving the efficiency of existing pathology workflows.

N2  - Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women worldwide. The standard histopathology of breast tissue, the primary means of disease diagnosis, involves manual microscopic examination of stained tissue by a pathologist. Because this method relies on qualitative information, it can result in inter-observer variation. Furthermore, for difficult cases the pathologist often needs additional markers of malignancy to help in making a diagnosis, a need that can potentially be met by novel microscopy methods. We present a quantitative method for label-free breast tissue evaluation using Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM). By extracting tissue markers of malignancy based on the nanostructure revealed by the optical path-length, our method provides an objective, label-free and potentially automatable method for breast histopathology. We demonstrated our method by imaging a tissue microarray consisting of 68 different subjects-34 with malignant and 34 with benign tissues. Three-fold cross validation results showed a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 85% for detecting cancer. Our disease signatures represent intrinsic physical attributes of the sample, independent of staining quality, facilitating classification through machine learning packages since our images do not vary from scan to scan or instrument to instrument.

N2  - Brain connectivity spans over broad spatial scales, from nanometers to centimeters. In order to understand the brain at multi-scale, the neural network in wide-field has been visualized in detail by taking advantage of light microscopy. However, the process of staining or addition of fluorescent tags is commonly required, and the image contrast is insufficient for delineation of cytoarchitecture. To overcome this barrier, we use spatial light interference microscopy to investigate brain structure with high-resolution, sub-nanometer pathlength sensitivity without the use of exogenous contrast agents. Combining wide-field imaging and a mosaic algorithm developed in-house, we show the detailed architecture of cells and myelin, within coronal olfactory bulb and cortical sections, and from sagittal sections of the hippocampus and cerebellum. Our technique is well suited to identify laminar characteristics of fiber tract orientation within white matter, e.g. the corpus callosum. To further improve the macro-scale contrast of anatomical structures, and to better differentiate axons and dendrites from cell bodies, we mapped the tissue in terms of its scattering property. Based on our results, we anticipate that spatial light interference microscopy can potentially provide multiscale and multicontrast perspectives of gross and microscopic brain anatomy.

N2  - Due to their diameter, of only 24 nm, single microtubules are extremely challenging to image without the use of extrinsic contrast agents. As a result, fluorescence tagging is the common method to visualize their motility. However, such investigation is limited by photobleaching and phototoxicity. We experimentally demonstrate the capability of combining label-free spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) with numerical processing for imaging single microtubules in a gliding assay. SLIM combines four different intensity images to obtain the optical path length map associated with the sample. Because of the use of broadband fields, the sensitivity to path length is better than 1 nm without (temporal) averaging and better than 0.1 nm upon averaging. Our results indicate that SLIM can image the dynamics of microtubules in a full field of view, of 200 × 200 μm2, over many hours. Modeling the microtubule transport via the diffusion-advection equation, we found that the dispersion relation yields the standard deviation of the velocity distribution, without the need for tracking individual tubes. Interestingly, during a 2 h window, the microtubules begin to decelerate, at 100 pm/s2 over a 20 min period. Thus, SLIM is likely to serve as a useful tool for understanding molecular motor activity, especially over large time scales, where fluorescence methods are of limited utility.

N2  - The healing process is often significantly impaired under conditions of chronic or large area wounds, which are often treated clinically using autologous split-thickness skin grafts. However, in many cases, harvesting of donor tissue presents a serious problem such as in the case of very large area burns. In response to this, engineered biomaterials have emerged that attempt to mimic the natural skin environment or deliver a suitable therapy to assist in the healing process. In this study, a custom-built multimodal optical microscope capable of noninvasive structural and functional imaging is used to investigate both the engineered tissue microenvironment and the in vivo wound healing process. Investigation of various engineered scaffolds show the strong relationship among the microenvironment of the scaffold, the organization of the cells within the scaffold, and the delivery pattern of these cells onto the healing wound. Through noninvasive tracking of these processes and parameters, multimodal optical microscopy provides an important tool in the assessment of engineered scaffolds both in vitro and in vivo.

N2  - A combination of techniques from 3D printing, tissue engineering and biomaterials has yielded a new class of engineered biological robots that could be reliably controlled via applied signals. These machines are powered by a muscle strip composed of differentiated skeletal myofibers in a matrix of natural proteins, including fibrin, that provide physical support and cues to the cells as an engineered basement membrane. However, maintaining consistent results becomes challenging when sustaining a living system in vitro. Skeletal muscle must be preserved in a differentiated state and the system is subject to degradation by proteolytic enzymes that can break down its mechanical integrity. Here we examine the life expectancy, breakdown, and device failure of engineered skeletal muscle bio-bots as a result of degradation by three classes of proteases: Plasmin, cathepsin L, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). We also demonstrate the use of gelatin zymography to determine the effects of differentiation and inhibitor concentration on protease expression. With this knowledge, we are poised to design the next generation of complex biological machines with controllable function, specific life expectancy and greater consistency. These results could also prove useful for the study of disease-specific models, treatments of myopathies, and other tissue engineering applications.

N2  - Molecular interactions are studied as independent networks in systems biology. However, molecular networks do not exist independently of each other. In a network of networks approach (called multiplex), we study the joint organization of transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. We find that TRN and PPI are non-randomly coupled across five different eukaryotic species. Gene degrees in TRN (number of downstream genes) are positively correlated with protein degrees in PPI (number of interacting protein partners). Gene–gene and protein–protein interactions in TRN and PPI, respectively, also non-randomly overlap. These design principles are conserved across the five eukaryotic species. Robustness of the TRN–PPI multiplex is dependent on this coupling. Functionally important genes and proteins, such as essential, disease-related and those interacting with pathogen proteins, are preferentially situated in important parts of the human multiplex with highly overlapping interactions. We unveil the multiplex architecture of TRN and PPI. Multiplex architecture may thus define a general framework for studying molecular networks. This approach may uncover the building blocks of the hierarchical organization of molecular interactions.

N2  - Cellular interactions are a major driver for the assembly and functioning of microbial communities. Their strengths are shown to be highly variable in nature; however, it is unclear how such variations regulate community behaviors. Here we construct synthetic Lactococcus lactis consortia and mathematical models to elucidate the role of interaction variability in ecosystem succession and to further determine if casting variability into modeling empowers bottom-up predictions. For a consortium of bacteriocin-mediated cooperation and competition, we find increasing the variations of cooperation, from either altered labor partition or random sampling, drives the community into distinct structures. When the cooperation and competition are additionally modulated by pH, ecosystem succession becomes jointly controlled by the variations of both interactions and yields more diversified dynamics. Mathematical models incorporating variability successfully capture all of these experimental observations. Our study demonstrates interaction variability as a key regulator of community dynamics, providing insights into bottom-up predictions of microbial ecosystems.

N2  - Integration of conductive electrodes with 3D tissue models can have great potential for applications in bioelectronics, drug screening, and implantable devices. As conventional electrodes cannot be easily integrated on 3D, polymeric, and biocompatible substrates, alternatives are highly desirable. Graphene offers significant advantages over conventional electrodes due to its mechanical flexibility and robustness, biocompatibility, and electrical properties. However, the transfer of chemical vapor deposition graphene onto millimeter scale 3D structures is challenging using conventional wet graphene transfer methods with a rigid poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) supportive layer. Here, a biocompatible 3D graphene transfer method onto 3D printed structure using a soft poly ethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) supportive layer to integrate the graphene layer with a 3D engineered ring of skeletal muscle tissue is reported. The use of softer PEGDA supportive layer, with a 105 times lower Young's modulus compared to PMMA, results in conformal integration of the graphene with 3D printed pillars and allows electrical stimulation and actuation of the muscle ring with various applied voltages and frequencies. The graphene integration method can be applied to many 3D tissue models and be used as a platform for electrical interfaces to 3D biological tissue system.

N2  - Microcantilever sensors can be largely divided by the operation mode and the measurement environment. The operation mode of microcantilever sensors can be either the static mode based on the cantilever deflection or the dynamic mode based on the resonant frequency. The measurement environment often determines the type of sample entities and limits the sensitivity of the microcantilever sensor. The measurement environment can be in vacuum, in air, or in liquid. In this chapter, the microcantilever sensors in each category will be reviewed and one exemplary work will be discussed in further detail.

N2  - Cells communicate with each other through biochemical and electrical mechanisms employing various autocrine and endocrine signaling pathways. Cells, and cardiomyocytes in particular, generate contractile forces on the substrates (or tissues) they adhere to. This results in a tensile strain field in the substrate around the contractile cell. As a result, nearby cells adhered to the same substrate get stretched. The effect of this long range communication has received limited attention to date. Here we develop an elastic cell culture substrate to explore strain mediated coupling in cardiomyocytes. We investigate (1) whether strain coupling of isolated cardiomyocytes affects the temporal dynamics of contractility, (2) whether such long range communication can enable synchrony in cardiomyocyte beating, and (3) what is the biophysical mechanism enabling strain induced coupling? Initial experiments show that strain coupled populations of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes can synchronize their beating with time. We hypothesize that the contraction of one cell cluster results in calcium influx in the coupled cell cluster via stretch sensitive ion channels. We utilize an integrate-and-fire oscillator model with strain induced coupling to predict the emergence of synchrony between cardiomyocytes. This finding may shed light on cardiac arrhythmias in stiffened, infarcted cardiac tissues where strain coupling may be compromised.

N2  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second deadliest cancer in the US due to its propensity to metastasize. Stromal cells and especially cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) play a critical biophysical role in cancer progression, but the precise pro-metastatic mechanisms are not clear. Activin A, a TGF-β family member, is a strong pro-metastatic cytokine in the context of CRC. Here, we assessed the link between biophysical forces and pro-metastatic signaling by testing the hypothesis that CAF-generated mechanical forces lead to activin A release and associated downstream effects. Consistent with our hypothesis, we first determined that stromal activin A secretion increased with increasing substrate stiffness. Then we found that stromally-secreted activin A induced ligand-dependent CRC epithelial cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, serum activin A levels are significantly increased in metastatic (stage IV) CRC patients (1.558 ng/ml versus 0.4179 ng/ml, p < 0.05). We propose that increased tumor microenvironment stiffness leads to stromal cell-mediated TGF-β family signaling relying on the induction and utilization of activin A signaling.

N2  - We studied collagen fiber organization in tissue affected by pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and compared it to asymptomatic controls. Both the control and POP tissue biopsies were prepared and measured by a highly sensitive quantitative phase imaging (QPI) system, called spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM). Combined with automatic image processing, this modality provides quantitative, high-throughput assessment of fiber morphology. We found the fiber orientation in prolapsed specimens is less homogeneous, indicating an abnormal organization of collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM).

N2  - Kv7 channels are enriched at the axonal plasma membrane where their voltage-dependent potassium currents suppress neuronal excitability. Mutations in Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits cause epileptic encephalopathy (EE), yet the underlying pathogenetic mechanism is unclear. Here, we used novel statistical algorithms and structural modeling to identify EE mutation hotspots in key functional domains of Kv7.2 including voltage sensing S4, the pore loop and S6 in the pore domain, and intracellular calmodulin-binding helix B and helix B-C linker. Characterization of selected EE mutations from these hotspots revealed that L203P at S4 induces a large depolarizing shift in voltage dependence of Kv7.2 channels and L268F at the pore decreases their current densities. While L268F severely reduces expression of heteromeric channels in hippocampal neurons without affecting internalization, K552T and R553L mutations at distal helix B decrease calmodulin-binding and axonal enrichment. Importantly, L268F, K552T, and R553L mutations disrupt current potentiation by increasing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and our molecular dynamics simulation suggests PIP2 interaction with these residues. Together, these findings demonstrate that each EE variant causes a unique combination of defects in Kv7 channel function and neuronal expression, and suggest a critical need for both prediction algorithms and experimental interrogations to understand pathophysiology of Kv7-associated EE.

N2  - Viral load quantification is a critical need for HIV management worldwide. However, the diagnostic technologies currently available are too limited by their size and expense to reach many remote and resource-limited populations. Toward the development of techniques which can be leveraged for point-of-care assays, we have investigated affinity capture of whole viruses using magnetic microparticles functionalized with antibodies or proteins targeting components of the HIV envelope. Results show the best performance from T-20, a small peptide employed in antiretroviral pharmacotherapy which targets an HIV envelope protein. This demonstration introduces an interesting alternative to antibodies for future affinity-capture applications in HIV diagnostics.

N2  - The capacity for microscopic evaluation of sperm is useful for assisted reproductive technologies (ART), because this can allow for specific selection of sperm cells for in vitro fertilization (IVF). The objective of this study was to analyze the same sperm samples using two high-resolution methods: spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine if with one method there was more timely and different information obtained than the other. To address this objective, there was evaluation of sperm populations from boars and stallions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported comparison when using AFM and high-sensitivity interferometric microscopy (such as SLIM) to evaluate spermatozoa. Results indicate that with the use of SLIM microscopy there is similar nanoscale sensitivity as with use of AFM while there is approximately 1,000 times greater throughput with use of SLIM. With SLIM, there is also allowace for the measurement of the dry mass (non-aqueous content) of spermatozoa, which may be a new label-free marker for sperm viability. In the second part of this study, there was analysis of two sperm populations. There were interesting correlations between the different compartments of the sperm and the dry mass in both boars and stallions. Furthermore, there was a correlation between the dry mass of the sperm head and the length and width of the acrosome in both boars and stallions. This correlation is positive in boars while it is negative in stallions.

N2  - Enzymatic DNA amplification-based approaches involving intercalating DNA-binding fluorescent dyes and expensive optical detectors are the gold standard for nucleic acid detection. As components of a simplified and miniaturized system, conventional silicon-based ion sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs) that measure a decrease in pH due to the generation of pyrophosphates during DNA amplification have been previously reported. In this article, Bst polymerase in a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction combined with target-specific primers and crumpled graphene field effect transistors (gFETs) to electrically detect amplification by sensing the reduction in primers is used. Graphene is known to adsorb single-stranded DNA due to noncovalent π–π bonds, but not double-stranded DNA. This approach does not require any surface functionalization and allows the detection of primer concentrations at the endpoint of reactions. As recently demonstrated, the crumpled gFET over the conventional flat gFET sensors due to their superior sensitivity is chosen. The endpoint of amplification reaction with starting concentrations down to 8 × 10−21 m in 90 min including the time of amplification and detection is detected. With its high sensitivity and small footprint, this platform will help bring complex lab-based diagnostic and genotyping amplification assays to the point-of-care.

As components of a simplified and miniaturized system, conventional silicon-based ion sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs) that measure a decrease in pH due to the generation of pyrophosphates during DNA amplification have been previously reported. In this article, Bst polymerase in a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction combined with target-specific primers and crumpled graphene field effect transistors (gFETs) to electrically detect amplification by sensing the reduction in primers is used. Graphene is known to adsorb single-stranded DNA due to noncovalent π–π bonds, but not double-stranded DNA. This approach does not require any surface functionalization and allows the detection of primer concentrations at the endpoint of reactions. As recently demonstrated, the crumpled gFET over the conventional flat gFET sensors due to their superior sensitivity is chosen. The endpoint of amplification reaction with starting concentrations down to 8 × 10−21 m in 90 min including the time of amplification and detection is detected. With its high sensitivity and small footprint, this platform will help bring complex lab-based diagnostic and genotyping amplification assays to the point-of-care.

N2  - To gain a quantitative understanding of the way cells sense, process, and respond to dynamic environmental signals in real-time requires developing in vitro model systems that accurately replicate the 3D structure and function of native tissue. A high-resolution projection stereolithography apparatus (μSLA) capable of multimaterial and grayscale 3D patterning of cells and biomaterials at <5 μm resolution is presented. Murine cells (fibroblasts, myoblasts, endothelial, and bone marrow stromal cells) encapsulated within photosensitive hydrogels using the μSLA remain viable up to two weeks after fabrication. Harnessing the high-resolution fabrication capabilities of this machine, sub-millimeter scale angiogenic cell-encapsulating patches designed to promote targeted growth of neovasculature are printed, as assessed in vitro via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in ovo via a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM). This application establishes the μSLA as an enabling technology that is widely adaptable to any application that requires high-resolution patterning of cells and cells signals. By providing an efficient and robust method of engineering microscale tissues with encapsulated cells, this apparatus has a range of applications including fundamental studies of extracellular matrix interactions, high throughput drug testing of physiologically relevant substitutes for native tissue, and programmable tissue engineering for applications in regenerative medicine.

N2  - Retrieving electrical impedance maps at the nanoscale rapidly via nondestructive inspection with a high signal-to-noise ratio is an unmet need, likely to impact various applications from biomedicine to energy conversion. In this study, we develop a multimodal functional imaging instrument that is characterized by the dual capability of impedance mapping and phase quantitation, high spatial resolution, and low temporal noise. To achieve this, we advance a quantitative phase imaging system, referred to as epi-magnified image spatial spectrum microscopy combined with electrical actuation, to provide complementary maps of the optical path and electrical impedance. We demonstrate our system with high-resolution maps of optical path differences and electrical impedance variations that can distinguish nanosized, semi-transparent, structured coatings involving two materials with relatively similar electrical properties. We map heterogeneous interfaces corresponding to an indium tin oxide layer exposed by holes with diameters as small as ~550 nm in a titanium (dioxide) over-layer deposited on a glass support. We show that electrical modulation during the phase imaging of a macro-electrode is decisive for retrieving electrical impedance distributions with submicron spatial resolution and beyond the limitations of electrode-based technologies (surface or scanning technologies). The findings, which are substantiated by a theoretical model that fits the experimental data very well enable achieving electro-optical maps with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The virtues and limitations of the novel optoelectrochemical method that provides grounds for a wider range of electrically modulated optical methods for measuring the electric field locally are critically discussed.

N2  - We provide an experimental demonstration of Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM) as a tool for measuring the motion of 25 nm tubulin structures without the use of florescence labels. Compared to intensity imaging methods such as phase contrast or DIC, our imaging technique relies on the ratios of images associated with optically introduced phase shifts, thus implicitly removing background illumination. To demonstrate our new found capabilities, we characterize kinesin-based motility continuously over periods of time where fluorescence would typically photobleach. We exploit this new method to compare the motility of microtubules at low ATP concentrations, with and without the tagging proteins formerly required to perform these studies. Our preliminary results show that the tags have a non-negligible effect on the microtubule motility, slowing the process down by more than 10%.

N2  - KCNQ/Kv7 channels conduct voltage-dependent outward potassium currents that potently decrease neuronal excitability. Heterozygous inherited mutations in their principle subunits Kv7.2/KCNQ2 and Kv7.3/KCNQ3 cause benign familial neonatal epilepsy whereas patients with de novo heterozygous Kv7.2 mutations are associated with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay and autism. However, the role of Kv7.2-containing Kv7 channels in behaviors especially autism-associated behaviors has not been described. Because pathogenic Kv7.2 mutations in patients are typically heterozygous loss-of-function mutations, we investigated the contributions of Kv7.2 to exploratory, social, repetitive and compulsive-like behaviors by behavioral phenotyping of both male and female KCNQ2+/− mice that were heterozygous null for the KCNQ2 gene. Compared with their wild-type littermates, male and female KCNQ2+/− mice displayed increased locomotor activity in their home cage during the light phase but not the dark phase and showed no difference in motor coordination, suggesting hyperactivity during the inactive light phase. In the dark phase, KCNQ2+/− group showed enhanced exploratory behaviors, and repetitive grooming but decreased sociability with sex differences in the degree of these behaviors. While male KCNQ2+/− mice displayed enhanced compulsive-like behavior and social dominance, female KCNQ2+/− mice did not. In addition to elevated seizure susceptibility, our findings together indicate that heterozygous loss of Kv7.2 induces behavioral abnormalities including autism-associated behaviors such as reduced sociability and enhanced repetitive behaviors. Therefore, our study is the first to provide a tangible link between loss-of-function Kv7.2 mutations and the behavioral comorbidities of Kv7.2-associated epilepsy.

N2  - Helicobacter pylori (Hp) vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) is a bacterial exotoxin that enters host cells and induces mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the extent to which VacA-dependent mitochondrial perturbations affect overall cellular metabolism is poorly understood. We report that VacA perturbations in mitochondria are linked to alterations in cellular amino acid homeostasis, which results in the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and subsequent autophagy. mTORC1, which regulates cellular metabolism during nutrient stress, is inhibited during Hp infection by a VacA-dependent mechanism. This VacA-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 signaling is linked to the dissociation of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface and results in activation of cellular autophagy through the Unc 51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1) complex. VacA intoxication results in reduced cellular amino acids, and bolstering amino acid pools prevents VacA-mediated mTORC1 inhibition. Overall, these studies support a model that Hp modulate host cell metabolism through the action of VacA at mitochondria. Dysregulation of host metabolism is emerging as an important strategy for microbial remodeling of the infection microenvironment. Kim et al. report a key sensor of host nutritional status, mTORC1, is inhibited by a mitochondrial-targeting bacterial toxin, Helicobacter pylori VacA, resulting in an overall cellular shift from biosynthetic to catabolic metabolism.

N2  - Second-harmonic generation microscopy is a valuable label-free modality for imaging non-centrosymmetric structures and has important biomedical applications from live-cell imaging to cancer diagnosis. Conventional second-harmonic generation microscopy measures intensity signals that originate from tightly focused laser beams, preventing researchers from solving the scattering inverse problem for second-order nonlinear materials. Here, we present harmonic optical tomography (HOT) as a novel modality for imaging microscopic, nonlinear and inhomogeneous objects. The HOT principle of operation relies on interferometrically measuring the complex harmonic field and using a scattering inverse model to reconstruct the three-dimensional distribution of harmonophores. HOT enables strong axial sectioning via the momentum conservation of spatially and temporally broadband fields. We illustrate the HOT operation with experiments and reconstructions on a beta-barium borate crystal and various biological specimens. Although our results involve second-order nonlinear materials, we show that this approach applies to any coherent nonlinear process.

N2  - Differential phase sensitive methods, such as Nomarski microscopy, play an important role in quantitative phase imaging due to their compatibility with partially coherent illumination and excellent optical sectioning ability. In this Letter, we propose a new system, to the best of our knowledge, to retrieve differential phase information from transparent samples. It is based on a 4f optical system with an amplitude-type spatial light modulator (SLM), which removes the need for traditional differential interference contrast (DIC) optics and specialized phase-only SLMs. We demonstrate the principle of harmonically decoupled gradient light interference microscopy using standard samples, as well as static and dynamic biospecimens.

N2  - Infectious diseases remain the world’s top contributors to death and disability, and, with recent outbreaks of Zika virus infections there has been an urgency for simple, sensitive and easily translatable point-of-care tests. Here we demonstrate a novel point-of-care platform to diagnose infectious diseases from whole blood samples. A microfluidic platform performs minimal sample processing in a user-friendly diagnostics card followed by real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) on the same card with pre-dried primers specific to viral targets. Our point-of-care platform uses a commercial smartphone to acquire real-time images of the amplification reaction and displays a visual read-out of the assay. We apply this system to detect closely related Zika, Dengue (types 1 and 3) and Chikungunya virus infections from whole blood on the same pre-printed chip with high specificity and clinically relevant sensitivity. Limit of detection of 1.56e5 PFU/mL of Zika virus from whole blood was achieved through our platform. With the ability to quantitate the target nucleic acid, this platform can also perform point-of-care patient surveillance for pathogen load or select biomarkers in whole blood.

N2  - We present a new approach for retrieving halo-free phase contrast microscopy (hfPC) images by upgrading the conventional PC microscope with an external interferometric module, which generates sufficient data for reversing the halo artifact. Acquiring four independent intensity images, our approach first measures haloed phase maps of the sample. We solve for the halo-free sample transmission function by using a physical model of the image formation under partial spatial coherence. Using this halo-free sample transmission, we can numerically generate artifact-free PC images. Furthermore, this transmission can be further used to obtain quantitative information about the sample, e.g., the thickness with known refractive indices, dry mass of live cells during their cycles. We tested our hfPC method on various control samples, e.g., beads, pillars and validated its potential for biological investigation by imaging live HeLa cells, red blood cells, and neurons.

N2  - Intracellular transport is fundamental for neuronal function and development and is dependent on the formation of stable actin filaments. N-cadherin, a cell–cell adhesion protein, is actively involved in neuronal growth and actin cytoskeleton organization. Various groups have explored how neurons behaved on substrates engineered to present N-cadherin; however, few efforts have been made to examine how these surfaces modulate neuronal intracellular transport. To address this issue, we assembled a substrate to which recombinant N-cadherin molecules are physiosorbed using graphene oxide (GO)or reduced graphene oxide (rGO). N-cadherin physisorbed on GO and rGO led to a substantial enhancement of intracellular mass transport along neurites relative to N-cadherin on glass, due to increased neuronal adhesion, neurite extensions, dendritic arborization and glial cell adhesion. This study will be broadly useful for recreating active neural tissues in vitro and for improving our understanding of the development, homeostasis, and physiology of neurons. Statement of Significance: Intracellular transport of proteins and chemical cues is extremely important for culturing neurons in vitro, as they replenish materials within and facilitate communication between neurons. Various studies have shown that intracellular transport is dependent on the formation of stable actin filaments. However, the extent to which cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion modulates intracellular transport is not heavily explored. In this study, N-cadherin was adsorbed onto graphene oxide-based substrates to understand the role of cadherin at a molecular level and the intracellular transport within cells was examined using spatial light interference microscopy. As such, the results of this study will serve to better understand and harness the role of cell–cell adhesion in neuron development and regeneration.

N2  - Multiple scattering limits the contrast in optical imaging of thick specimens. Here, we present gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM) to extract three-dimensional information from both thin and thick unlabeled specimens. GLIM exploits a special case of low-coherence interferometry to extract phase information from the specimen, which in turn can be used to measure cell mass, volume, surface area, and their evolutions in time. Because it combines multiple intensity images that correspond to controlled phase shifts between two interfering waves, gradient light interference microscopy is capable of suppressing the incoherent background due to multiple scattering. GLIM can potentially become a valuable tool for in vitro fertilization, where contrast agents and fluorophores may impact the viability of the embryo. Since GLIM is implemented as an add-on module to an existing inverted microscope, we anticipate that it will be adopted rapidly by the biological community.

N2  - The thermal fluctuations of membranes and nanoscale shells affect their mechanical characteristics. Whereas these fluctuations are well understood for flat membranes, curved shells show anomalous behavior due to the geometric coupling between inplane elasticity and out-of-plane bending. Using conventional shallow shell theory in combination with equilibrium statistical physics we theoretically demonstrate that thermalized shells containing regions of negative Gaussian curvature naturally develop anomalously large fluctuations. Moreover, the existence of special curves, "singular lines," leads to a breakdown of linear membrane theory. As a result, these geometric curves effectively partition the cell into regions whose fluctuations are only weakly coupled. We validate these predictions using high-resolution microscopy of human red blood cells (RBCs) as a case study. Our observations show geometry-dependent localization of thermal fluctuations consistent with our theoretical modeling, demonstrating the efficacy in combining shell theory with equilibrium statistical physics for describing the thermalized morphology of cellular membranes.

N2  - Daily oscillations of brain and body states are under complex temporal modulation by environmental light and the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock. To better understand mediators of differential temporal modulation, we characterize neuropeptide releasate profiles by nonselective capture of secreted neuropeptides in an optic nerve horizontal SCN brain slice model. Releasates are collected following electrophysiological stimulation of the optic nerve/retinohypothalamic tract under conditions that alter the phase of the SCN activity state. Secreted neuropeptides are identified by intact mass via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We found time-of-day-specific suites of peptides released downstream of optic nerve stimulation. Peptide release was modified differentially with respect to time-of-day by stimulus parameters and by inhibitors of glutamatergic or PACAPergic neurotransmission. The results suggest that SCN physiology is modulated by differential peptide release of both known and unexpected peptides that communicate time-of-day-specific photic signals via previously unreported neuropeptide signatures.

N2  - Soft slender structures are ubiquitous in natural and artificial systems, in active and passive settings and across scales, from polymers and flagella, to snakes and space tethers. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of a simple and practical numerical implementation based on the Cosserat rod model to simulate the dynamics of filaments that can bend, twist, stretch and shear while interacting with complex environments via muscular activity, surface contact, friction and hydrodynamics. We validate our simulations by solving a number of forward problems involving the mechanics of passive filaments and comparing them with known analytical results, and extend them to study instabilities in stretched and twisted filaments that form solenoidal and plectonemic structures. We then study active filaments such as snakes and other slender organisms by solving inverse problems to identify optimal gaits for limbless locomotion on solid surfaces and in bulk liquids.

N2  - Engineering stochastic fluctuations of gene expression (or "noise") is integral to precisely bias cellular-fate decisions and statistical phenotypes in both single-cell and multi-cellular systems. Epigenetic regulation has been shown to constitute a large source of noise, and thus, engineering stochasticity is deeply intertwined with epigenetics. Here, utilizing chromatin remodeling, we report that Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CA) and Pyrimethamine (PYR), two inhibitors of BAF250a, a subunit of the Brahma-associated factor (BAF) nucleosome remodeling complex, enable differential and tunable control of noise in transcription and translation from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat promoter in a dose and time-dependent manner. CA conserves noise levels while increasing mean abundance, resulting in direct tuning of the transcriptional burst size, while PYR strictly increases transcriptional initiation frequency while conserving a constant transcriptional burst size. Time-dependent treatment with CA reveals non-continuous tuning with noise oscillating at a constant mean abundance at early time points and the burst size increasing for treatments after 5 h. Treatments combining CA and Protein Kinase C agonists result in an even larger increase of abundance while conserving noise levels with a highly non-linear increase in variance of up to 63× untreated controls. Finally, drug combinations provide non-antagonistic combinatorial tuning of gene expression noise and map a noise phase space for future applications with viral and synthetic gene vectors. Active remodeling of nucleosomes and BAF-mediated control of gene expression noise expand a toolbox for the future design and engineering of stochasticity in living systems.

Here, utilizing chromatin remodeling, we report that Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CA) and Pyrimethamine (PYR), two inhibitors of BAF250a, a subunit of the Brahma-associated factor (BAF) nucleosome remodeling complex, enable differential and tunable control of noise in transcription and translation from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat promoter in a dose and time-dependent manner. CA conserves noise levels while increasing mean abundance, resulting in direct tuning of the transcriptional burst size, while PYR strictly increases transcriptional initiation frequency while conserving a constant transcriptional burst size. Time-dependent treatment with CA reveals non-continuous tuning with noise oscillating at a constant mean abundance at early time points and the burst size increasing for treatments after 5 h. Treatments combining CA and Protein Kinase C agonists result in an even larger increase of abundance while conserving noise levels with a highly non-linear increase in variance of up to 63× untreated controls. Finally, drug combinations provide non-antagonistic combinatorial tuning of gene expression noise and map a noise phase space for future applications with viral and synthetic gene vectors. Active remodeling of nucleosomes and BAF-mediated control of gene expression noise expand a toolbox for the future design and engineering of stochasticity in living systems.

N2  - Investigating the growth signatures of single cells will determine how cell growth is regulated and cell size is maintained. The ability to precisely measure such changes and alterations in cell size and cell mass could be important for applications in cancer and drug screening. Here, we measure the mass growth rate of individual benign (MCF-10A), non-invasive (MCF-7), and highly-invasive malignant (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells. A micro-patterning technique was employed to allow for the long-term growth of motile cells. Results show mass growth rates at 4.8%, 1.2%, and 2.8% for MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231, demonstrating that normal cells have a higher mass growth rate than cancerous cells. All the cell lines show an increase in mass change rate indicating that the mass accumulation rate is exponential over a single cell cycle. The growth rates measured with our MEMS sensor are compared with doubling times obtained through conventional bulk analysis techniques, and exhibit excellent agreement.

N2  - The neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4–2, Nedd4-2, is an epilepsy-associated gene with at least three missense mutations identified in epileptic patients. Nedd4-2 encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase that has high affinity toward binding and ubiquitinating membrane proteins. It is currently unknown how Nedd4-2 mediates neuronal circuit activity and how its dysfunction leads to seizures or epilepsies. In this study, we provide evidence to show that Nedd4-2 mediates neuronal activity and seizure susceptibility through ubiquitination of GluA1 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor, (AMPAR). Using a mouse model, termed Nedd4-2andi, in which one of the major forms of Nedd4-2 in the brain is selectively deficient, we found that the spontaneous neuronal activity in Nedd4-2andicortical neuron cultures, measured by a multiunit extracellular electrophysiology system, was basally elevated, less responsive to AMPAR activation, and much more sensitive to AMPAR blockade when compared with wild-type cultures. When performing kainic acid-induced seizures in vivo, we showed that elevated seizure susceptibility in Nedd4-2andimice was normalized when GluA1 is genetically reduced. Furthermore, when studying epilepsy-associated missense mutations of Nedd4-2, we found that all three mutations disrupt the ubiquitination of GluA1 and fail to reduce surface GluA1 and spontaneous neuronal activity when compared with wild-type Nedd4-2. Collectively, our data suggest that impaired GluA1 ubiquitination contributes to Nedd4-2-dependent neuronal hyperactivity and seizures. Our findings provide critical information to the future development of therapeutic strategies for patients who carry mutations of Nedd4-2.

N2  - Multiple scattering and absorption limit the depth at which biological tissues can be imaged with light. In thick unlabeled specimens, multiple scattering randomizes the phase of the field and absorption attenuates light that travels long optical paths. These obstacles limit the performance of transmission imaging. To mitigate these challenges, we developed an epi-illumination gradient light interference microscope (epi-GLIM) as a label-free phase imaging modality applicable to bulk or opaque samples. Epi-GLIM enables studying turbid structures that are hundreds of microns thick and otherwise opaque to transmitted light. We demonstrate this approach with a variety of man-made and biological samples that are incompatible with imaging in a transmission geometry: semiconductors wafers, specimens on opaque and birefringent substrates, cells in microplates, and bulk tissues. We demonstrate that the epi-GLIM data can be used to solve the inverse scattering problem and reconstruct the tomography of single cells and model organisms.

N2  - The progression of cancer is often accompanied by changes in the mechanical properties of an extracellular matrix. However, limited efforts have been made to reproduce these biological events in vitro. To this end, this study demonstrates that matrix remodeling caused by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 regulates phenotypic activities and modulates radiosensitivity of cancer cells exclusively in a 3D matrix. In this study, hepatocarcinoma cells are cultured in a collagen-based gel tailored to present an elastic modulus of ≈4.0 kPa. The subsequent exposure of the gel to MMP-1 decreases the elastic modulus from 4.0 to 0.5 kPa. In response to MMP-1, liver cancer cells undergo active proliferation, downregulation of E-cadherin, and the loss of detoxification capacity. The resulting spheroids are more sensitive to radiation than the spheroids cultured in the stiffer gel not exposed to MMP-1. Overall, this study serves to better understand and control the effects of MMP-induced matrix remodeling.

N2  - Condensation is a universal phenomenon that occurs in nature and industry. Previous studies have used superhydrophobicity and liquid infusion to enable superior liquid repellency due to reduced contact angle hysteresis. However, small condensate droplets remain immobile on condensing surfaces until they grow to the departing size at which the body force can overcome the contact line pinning force. Hence, condensation heat transfer is limited by these remaining droplets that act as thermal barriers. To break these limitations, we introduce vibrational actuation to a slippery liquid-infused nanoporous surface (SLIPS) and show enhanced droplet mobility, controllable condensate repellency, and more efficient heat transfer compared to static SLIPSs. We demonstrate 39% smaller departing droplet size and 8× faster droplet departing speeds on the dynamic vibrating SLIPS compared to the nonactuated SLIPS. To understand the implications of these behaviors on heat transfer, we investigate the condensate area coverage and droplet distribution to verify enhanced dewetting on dynamic vibrating SLIPSs. Using well-validated heat transfer models, we demonstrate enhanced condensation heat transfer on dynamic SLIPSs due to the higher population of smaller condensate droplets (<100 μm). In addition to condensation heat transfer, we also show that vibrating SLIPSs can enhance droplet collection. This work utilizes the synergistic combination of surface chemistry and mechanical actuation to realize enhanced droplet mobility and heat transfer in an electrically controllable and switchable manner.

N2  - Biological cells are complex living machines that have garnered significant attention for their potential to serve as a new generation of therapeutic and delivery agents. Because of their secretion, differentiation, and homing activities, therapeutic cells have tremendous potential to treat or even cure various diseases and injuries that have defied conventional therapeutic strategies. Therapeutic cells can be systemically or locally transplanted. In addition, with their ability to express receptors that bind specific tissue markers, cells are being studied as nano- or microsized drug carriers capable of targeted transport. Depending on the therapeutic targets, these cells may be clustered to promote intercellular adhesion. Despite some impressive results with preclinical studies, there remain several obstacles to their broader development, such as a limited ability to control their transport, engraftment, secretion and to track them in vivo. Additionally, creating a particular spatial organization of therapeutic cells remains difficult. Efforts have recently emerged to resolve these challenges by engineering cell surfaces with a myriad of bioactive molecules, nanoparticles, and microparticles that, in turn, improve the therapeutic efficacy of cells. This review article assesses the various technologies developed to engineer the cell surfaces. The review ends with future considerations that should be taken into account to further advance the quality of cell surface engineering.

N2  - Engineered polymer vesicles, termed as polymersomes, confer a flexibility to control their structure, properties, and functionality. Self-assembly of amphiphilic copolymers leads to vesicles consisting of a hydrophobic bilayer membrane and hydrophilic core, each of which is loaded with a wide array of small and large molecules of interests. As such, polymersomes are increasingly being studied as carriers of imaging probes and therapeutic drugs. Effective delivery of polymersomes necessitates careful design of polymersomes. Therefore, this review article discusses the design strategies of polymersomes developed for enhanced transport and efficacy of imaging probes and therapeutic drugs. In particular, the article focuses on overviewing technologies to regulate the size, structure, shape, surface activity, and stimuli- responsiveness of polymersomes and discussing the extent to which these properties and structure of polymersomes influence the efficacy of cargo molecules. Taken together with future considerations, this article will serve to improve the controllability of polymersome functions and accelerate the use of polymersomes in biomedical applications.

N2  - Formation of tissue models in 3 dimensions is more effective in recapitulating structure and function compared to their 2-dimensional (2D) counterparts. Formation of 3D engineered tissue to control shape and size can have important implications in biomedical research and in engineering applications such as biological soft robotics. While neural spheroids routinely are created during differentiation processes, further geometric control of in vitro neural models has not been demonstrated. Here, we present an approach to form functional in vitro neural tissue mimic (NTM) of different shapes using stem cells, a fibrin matrix, and 3D printed molds. We used murine-derived embryonic stem cells for optimizing cell-seeding protocols, characterization of the resulting internal structure of the construct, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, as well as validation of electrophysiological activity. Then, we used these findings to bio-fabricate these constructs using neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells. This method can provide a large degree of design flexibility for development of in vitro functional neural tissue models of varying forms for therapeutic biomedical research, drug discovery, and disease modeling, and engineering applications.

N2  - This paper entails the application of the energy shaping methodology to control a flexible, elastic Cosserat rod model. Recent interest in such continuum models stems from applications in soft robotics, and from the growing recognition of the role of mechanics and embodiment in biological control strategies: octopuses are often regarded as iconic examples of this interplay. The dynamics of the Cosserat rod, here modeling a single octopus arm, are treated as a Hamiltonian system and the internal muscle actuators are modeled as distributed forces and couples. The proposed energy shaping control design procedure involves two steps: (1) a potential energy is designed such that its minimizer is the desired equilibrium configuration; (2) an energy shaping control law is implemented to reach the desired equilibrium. By interpreting the controlled Hamiltonian as a Lyapunov function, asymptotic stability of the equilibrium configuration is deduced. The energy shaping control law is shown to require only the deformations of the equilibrium configuration. A forward-backward algorithm is proposed to compute these deformations in an online iterative manner. The overall control design methodology is implemented and demonstrated in a dynamic simulation environment. Results of several bio-inspired numerical experiments involving the control of octopus arms are reported.

N2  - In this Letter, we present, to our knowledge, the first endoscopic diffraction phase microscopy (eDPM) system. This instrument consists of a gradient-index-lens-based endoscope probe followed by a DPM module, which enables single-shot phase imaging at a single-cell-level resolution. Using the phase information provided by eDPM, we show that the geometric aberrations associated with the endoscope can be reduced by digitally applying a spectral phase filter to the raw data. The filter function is a linear combination of polynomials with weighting optimized to improve resolution. We validate the principle of the proposed method using reflective semiconductor samples and blood cells. This research extends the current scope of quantitative phase imaging applications, and proves its potential for future in vivo studies.

N2  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration of brain regions that are crucial for learning and memory. Although intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular senile plaques, composed of insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, have been the hallmarks of postmortem AD brains, memory impairment in early AD correlates better with pathological accumulation of soluble Aβ oligomers and persistent weakening of excitatory synaptic strength, which is demonstrated by inhibition of long-term potentiation, enhancement of long-term depression, and loss of synapses. However, current, approved interventions aiming to reduce Aβ levels have failed to retard disease progression; this has led to a pressing need to identify and target alternative pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Recently, it has been suggested that the disruption of Hebbian synaptic plasticity in AD is due to aberrant metaplasticity, which is a form of homeostatic plasticity that tunes the magnitude and direction of future synaptic plasticity based on previous neuronal or synaptic activity. This review examines emerging evidence for aberrant metaplasticity in AD. Putative mechanisms underlying aberrant metaplasticity in AD will also be discussed. We hope this review inspires future studies to test the extent to which these mechanisms contribute to the etiology of AD and offer therapeutic targets.

N2  - Contractile dynamics of primary cardiomyocyte clusters is studied by culturing them on deformable thin polymeric films. The cell clusters beat and generate sufficient forces to deform the substrates out of plane. Over time, the clusters reorient their force dipoles along the direction of maximum compliance. This suggests that the cells are capable of sensing substrate deformations through a mechanosensitive feedback mechanism and dynamically reorganizing themselves.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the world in 2020 by spreading at unprecedented rates and causing tens of thousands of fatalities within a few months. The number of deaths dramatically increased in regions where the number of patients in need of hospital care exceeded the availability of care. Many COVID-19 patients experience Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a condition that can be treated with mechanical ventilation. In response to the need for mechanical ventilators, designed and tested an emergency ventilator (EV) that can control a patient's peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and breathing rate, while keeping a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). This article describes the rapid design, prototyping, and testing of the EV. The development process was enabled by rapid design iterations using additive manufacturing (AM). In the initial design phase, iterations between design, AM, and testing enabled a working prototype within one week. The designs of the 16 different components of the ventilator were locked by additively manufacturing and testing a total of 283 parts having parametrically varied dimensions. In the second stage, AM was used to produce 75 functional prototypes to support engineering evaluation and animal testing. The devices were tested over more than two million cycles. We also developed an electronic monitoring system and with automatic alarm to provide for safe operation, along with training materials and user guides. The final designs are available online under a free license. The designs have been transferred to more than 70 organizations in 15 countries. This project demonstrates the potential for ultra-fast product design, engineering, and testing of medical devices needed for COVID-19 emergency response.

N2  - Three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic systems hold great promise for the study of biological systems in vitro as well as for the development and testing of pharmaceuticals. Here, we test the hypothesis that an intact segment of lumbar rat spinal cord will form functional neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) with engineered, 3D muscle tissue, mimicking the partial development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Muscle tissues are grown on a 3D-printed polyethylene glycol (PEG) skeleton where deflection of the backbone due to muscle contraction causes the displacement of the pillar-like "feet."We show that spinal cord explants extend a robust and complex arbor of motor neurons and glia in vitro. We then engineered a "spinobot"by innervating the muscle tissue with an intact segment of lumbar spinal cord that houses the hindlimb locomotor central pattern generator (CPG). Within 7 days of the spinal cord being introduced to the muscle tissue, functional neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are formed, resulting in the development of an early PNS in vitro. The newly innervated muscles exhibit spontaneous contractions as measured by the displacement of pillars on the PEG skeleton. Upon chemical excitation, the spinal cord-muscle system initiated muscular twitches with a consistent frequency pattern. These sequences of contraction/relaxation suggest the action of a spinal CPG. Chemical inhibition with a blocker of neuronal glutamate receptors effectively blocked contractions. Overall, these data demonstrate that a rat spinal cord is capable of forming functional neuromuscular junctions ex vivo with an engineered muscle tissue at an ontogenetically similar timescale.

N2  - “Living” cell sheets or bioelectronic chips have great potentials to improve the quality of diagnostics and therapies. However, handling these thin and delicate materials remains a grand challenge because the external force applied for gripping and releasing can easily deform or damage the materials. This study presents a soft manipulator that can manipulate and transport cell/tissue sheets and ultrathin wearable biosensing devices seamlessly by recapitulating how a cephalopod’s suction cup works. The soft manipulator consists of an ultrafast thermo-responsive, microchanneled hydrogel layer with tissue-like softness and an electric heater layer. The electric current to the manipulator drives microchannels of the gel to shrink/expand and results in a pressure change through the microchannels. The manipulator can lift/detach an object within 10 s and can be used repeatedly over 50 times. This soft manipulator would be highly useful for safe and reliable assembly and implantation of therapeutic cell/tissue sheets and biosensing devices.

N2  - Electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) is an experimental animal model of electroconvulsive therapy, the most effective treatment for severe depression. ECS induces generalized tonic-clonic seizures with low mortality and neuronal death and is a widely-used model to screen anti-epileptic drugs. Here, we describe an ECS induction method in which a brief 55-mA current is delivered for 0.5 s to male rats 200-250 g in weight via ear-clip electrodes. Such bilateral stimulation produced stage 4-5 clonic seizures that lasted about 10 s. After the cessation of acute or chronic ECS, most rats recovered to be behaviorally indistinguishable from sham "no seizure" rats. Because ECS globally elevates brain activity, it has also been used to examine activity-dependent alterations of synaptic proteins and their effects on synaptic strength using multiple methods. In particular, subcellular fractionation of the postsynaptic density (PSD) in combination with Western blotting allows for the quantitative determination of the abundance of synaptic proteins at this specialized synaptic structure. In contrast to a previous fractionation method that requires large amount of rodent brains, we describe here a small-scale fractionation method to isolate the PSD from the hippocampi of a single rat, without sucrose gradient centrifugation. Using this method, we show that the isolated PSD fraction contains postsynaptic membrane proteins, including PSD95, GluN2B, and GluA2. Presynaptic marker synaptophysin and soluble cytoplasmic protein α-tubulin were excluded from the PSD fraction, demonstrating successful PSD isolation. Furthermore, chronic ECS decreased GluN2B expression in the PSD, indicating that our small-scale PSD fractionation method can be applied to detect the changes in hippocampal PSD proteins from a single rat after genetic, pharmacological, or mechanical treatments.

N2  - As the future of health care diagnostics moves toward more portable and personalized techniques, there is immense potential to harness the power of electrical signals for biological sensing and diagnostic applications at the point of care. Electrical biochips can be used to both manipulate and sense biological entities, as they can have several inherent advantages, including on-chip sample preparation, label-free detection, reduced cost and complexity, decreased sample volumes, increased portability, and large-scale multiplexing. The advantages of fully integrated electrical biochip platforms are particularly attractive for point-of-care systems. This review summarizes these electrical lab-on-a-chip technologies and highlights opportunities to accelerate the transition from academic publications to commercial success.

N2  - The development of three-dimensional (3D) cellular architectures during development and pathological processes involves intricate migratory patterns that are modulated by genetics and the surrounding microenvironment. The substrate composition of cell cultures has been demonstrated to influence growth, proliferation and migration in 2D. Here, we study the growth and dynamics of mouse embryonic fibroblast cultures patterned in a tissue sheet which then exhibits 3D growth. Using gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM), a label-free quantitative phase imaging approach, we explored the influence of geometry on cell growth patterns and rotational dynamics. We apply, for the first time to our knowledge, dispersion-relation phase spectroscopy (DPS) in polar coordinates to generate the radial and rotational cell mass-transport. Our data show that cells cultured on engineered substrates undergo rotational transport in a radially independent manner and exhibit faster vertical growth than the control, unpatterned cells. The use of GLIM and polar DPS provides a novel quantitative approach to studying the effects of spatially patterned substrates on cell motility and growth.

N2  - Chemical modification of titanium surfaces by hydrofluoric acid (HF) is an effective method to improve bone responses on titanium implant surfaces. In this study, titanium disks were sandblasted with titanium oxide grits and modified with 0.2% and 0.4% of diluted HF under different exposure times of 40 and 60 s. Surface characteristics, such as surface chemical composition, surface topography, and surface wettability, were investigated. To examine MG63 osteoblast-like cell responses to fluoride-modified titanium surfaces with roughness similar to that of nonmodified surfaces, a cell proliferation assay was performed and gene expression levels of Runx2 were evaluated using real-time PCR. Fluoride-modified titanium surfaces revealed no significant roughness difference but with hydrophilic properties than control group SB. Moreover, the relative atomic concentration percentages of fluoride were 0.7, 1.5, and 2.8. As fluoride concentrations increased, surface wettability increased and cell proliferation began earlier. However, the gene expression levels of Runx2 increased earlier on surfaces with 1.5% fluoride, with significantly high surface skewness. There seems to be an optimal fluoride concentration percentage when gene expression levels of Runx2 were taken into consideration. In addition, surface parameters, such as surface wettability and surface skewness, seem to be important factors in the enhancement of osteoblast differentiation by HF.

N2  - Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is an emerging modality, which enables the identification of abnormalities in tissue based on optical properties. QPI can be applied to any biological specimen due to its label-free imaging capability, but its use in stained tissue is unclear. Here, we study the variability of QPI with the staining dye. Several tissues such as brain, heart and lung were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and their optical properties compared at 550 and 730 nm. Our results showed that phase and scattering coefficients varied when QPI was used at the absorption wavelength of the staining dye. We also found that the variation of optical properties was dependent on tissue morphology.

N2  - Many recent studies on the viscoelasticity of individual cells link mechanics with cellular function and health. Here, we introduce a measurement of the viscoelastic properties of individual human colon cancer cells (HT-29) using silicon pedestal microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonant sensors. We demonstrate that the viscoelastic properties of single adherent cells can be extracted by measuring a difference in vibrational amplitude of our resonant sensor platform. The magnitude of vibration of the pedestal sensor is measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). A change in amplitude of the sensor, compared with the driving amplitude (amplitude ratio), is influenced by the mechanical properties of the adhered cells. The amplitude ratio of the fixed cells was greater than the live cells, with a p-value <0.0001. By combining the amplitude shift with the resonant frequency shift measure, we determined the elastic modulus and viscosity values of 100 Pa and 0.0031 Pa s, respectively. Our method using the change in amplitude of resonant MEMS devices can enable the determination of a refined solution space and could improve measuring the stiffness of cells.

N2  - Low cost, portable sensors can transform health care by bringing easily available diagnostic devices to low and middle income population, particularly in developing countries. Sample preparation, analyte handling and labeling are primary cost concerns for traditional lab-based diagnostic systems. Lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platforms based on droplet-based microfluidics promise to integrate and automate these complex and expensive laboratory procedures onto a single chip; the cost will be further reduced if label-free biosensors could be integrated onto the LoC platforms. Here, we review some recent developments of label-free, droplet-based biosensors, compatible with "open" digital microfluidic systems. These low-cost droplet-based biosensors overcome some of the fundamental limitations of the classical sensors, enabling timely diagnosis. We identify the key challenges that must be addressed to make these sensors commercially viable and summarize a number of promising research directions.

Chip contains an integrated T-junction droplet generator that enables segmentation of analytes flow in μm-scale microfluidic channels into a series of oil-isolated pL-volume aqueous droplets. Chip-integrated n-ESI emitter is designed to efficiently deliver segmented analytes for subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Engineered emitter nozzle geometry enables spatial and temporal separation of electro-sprayed oil and aqueous phases to monitor sampled neurochemicals on a droplet-by-droplet basis thus promising improved temporal and chemical sensitivity.

N2  - Localization of metabolites using multiplexed mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) provides important chemical information for biological research. In contrast to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), TiO2-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI) for MSI improves detection of low molecular mass metabolites (<500 Da) by reducing matrix background. However, the low UV absorption of TiO2 nanoparticles and their ester hydrolysis catalytic activity hinder the detection of phospholipids and many low-abundance molecules. To address these challenges, we evaluated and optimized the material morphology and composition of TiO2. Dopamine (DA) was found to be an efficient ligand for TiO2, resulting in increased UV light absorption, higher surface pH, and formation of monolithic TiO2-DA structures. The sub-micron scale and higher surface pH of the TiO2 particle sizes led to improved detection of phospholipid signals. Compared to unmodified TiO2 sub-micron particles, the DA-modified TiO2 monolith led to 10- to 30-fold increases in the signal-to-noise ratios of a number of compound peaks. The TiO2-DA monolith-assisted LDI MSI approach has higher selectivity and sensitivity for Lewis basic compounds, such as fatty acids, cholesterols, ceramides, diacylglycerols, and phosphatidylethanolamine, when analyzed in positive mode, than traditional MALDI MS. Using this new method, over 100 molecules, including amino acids, alkaloids, free fatty acids, peptides, and lipids, were localized in mouse brain sections. By comparing the presence and localization of those molecules in young and old mouse brains, the approach demonstrated good performance in the determination of aging-related neurochemical changes in the brain.

N2  - While it is well known that the cytoskeleton plays a fundamental role in maintaining cell shape, performing cell division, and intracellular transport, its spatiotemporal dynamics are insufficiently understood. The dispersion relation, which is fundamental for understanding the connection between spatial and temporal scales of a dynamic system, was employed here for the first time to study the activity of actin and microtubules. Using green fluorescence protein for time-lapse imaging of the cytoskeleton, we showed that the dispersion relation can distinguish between diffusive and active transport of actin and microtubule filaments. Our analysis revealed that along the filaments, the transport was deterministic, as one might expect as the result of the active polymerization process, while across the filaments diffusion was dominant. Furthermore, using drugs to block the polymerization–depolymerization of both actin and microtubules, we measured that the transport immediately became diffusive, as expected. However, unexpectedly, our results indicated that within a few minutes from blocking its polymerization, actin recovered an active transport component. This deterministic component vanished upon treatment with nocodazole, indicating that fragments of actin were actively transported along microtubules. Because it provides information over broad temporal and spatial scales, this approach promises to provide a new window into the active processes associated with live cells.

N2  - Tissue refractive index provides important information about morphology at the nanoscale. Since the malignant transformation involves both intra- and inter-cellular changes in the refractive index map, the tissue disorder measurement can be used to extract important diagnosis information. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) provides a practical means of extracting this information as it maps the optical path-length difference (OPD) across a tissue sample with sub-wavelength sensitivity. In this work, we employ QPI to compare the tissue disorder strength between benign and malignant breast tissue histology samples. Our results show that disease progression is marked by a significant increase in the disorder strength. Since our imaging system can be added as an upgrading module to an existing microscope, we anticipate that it can be integrated easily in the pathology work flow.

N2  - Herein, we report reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and pH-responsive biodegradable polyethylene glycol (PEG)-block-polycarbonate by installing thioether groups onto the polycarbonate and its self-assembled core/shell structured micelles for anticancer drug delivery. Oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxide and subsequently sulfone induces an increase in hydrophilicity, resulting in more hydrophilic micellar core. This phase-change caused the micelles to swell and enhance cargo release. Carboxylic acid groups have also been installed onto thioether-containing polycarbonate to promote loading of amine-containing anticancer doxorubicin through electrostatic interaction. Urea-functionalized thioether-containing PEG-block-polycarbonates were synthesized to mix with the acid-functionalized PEG-block-polycarbonate for stabilizing micelle structure through hydrogen-bonding interaction. The mixed micelles were 50 nm in diameter and had a 25 wt% loading capacity for doxorubicin. Enhanced drug release from the micelles was triggered by low pH and high content of ROS. Drug-encapsulated micelles accumulated in tumors through leaky tumor vasculature in PC-3 human prostate cancer xenograft mouse model.

N2  - Hydrodynamic loading greatly affects resonant characteristic of microfabricated structures immersed in a viscous fluid. In this letter, we demonstrate a technique to measure hydrodynamic loading on a MEMS resonator in a broad range of actuation frequency. The extracted hydrodynamic loading is in a good agreement with an analytical solution of an oscillating sphere, and a highly accurate model is developed for the hydrodynamic loading of the resonator. The developed technique can directly characterize the hydrodynamic loading of a microstructure with an arbitrary geometry and will facilitate the optimization of MEMS devices and AFM probes operating in a viscous fluid.

N2  - Bacterial biofilms form on and within many living tissues, medical devices, and engineered materials, threatening human health and sustainability. Removing biofilms remains a grand challenge despite tremendous efforts made so far, particularly when they are formed in confined spaces. One primary cause is the limited transport of antibacterial agents into extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the biofilm. In this study, we hypothesized that a microparticle engineered to be self-locomotive with microbubbles would clean a structure fouled by biofilm by fracturing the EPS and subsequently improving transports of the antiseptic reagent. We examined this hypothesis by doping a hollow cylinder-shaped diatom biosilica with manganese oxide (MnO2) nanosheets. In an antiseptic H2O2 solution, the diatoms doped by MnO2 nanosheets, denoted as diatom bubbler, discharged oxygen gas bubbles continuously and became self-motile. Subsequently, the diatoms infiltrated the bacterial biofilm formed on either flat or microgrooved silicon substrates and continued to generate microbubbles. The resulting microbubbles merged and converted surface energy to mechanical energy high enough to fracture the matrix of biofilm. Consequently, H2O2 molecules diffused into the biofilm and killed most bacterial cells. Overall, this study provides a unique and powerful tool that can significantly impact current efforts to clean a wide array of biofouled products and devices.

N2  - Neuronal control of skeletal muscle bioactuators represents a critical milestone toward the realization of future biohybrid machines that may generate complex motor patterns and autonomously navigate through their environment. Animals achieve these feats using neural networks that generate robust firing patterns and coordinate muscle activity through neuromuscular units. Here, we designed a versatile 3D neuron-muscle co-culture platform to serve as a test-bed for neuromuscular bioactuators. We used our platform in conjunction with microelectrode array electrophysiology to study the roles of synergistic interactions in the co-development of neural networks and muscle tissues. Our platform design enables co-culture of a neuronal cluster with up to four target muscle actuators, as well as quantification of muscle contraction forces. Using engineered muscle tissue targets, we first demonstrated the formation of functional neuromuscular bioactuators. We then investigated possible roles of long-range interactions in neuronal outgrowth patterns and observed preferential outgrowth toward muscles compared to the acellular matrix or fibroblasts, indicating muscle-specific chemotactic cues acting on motor neurons. Next, we showed that co-cultured muscle strips exhibited significantly higher spontaneous contractility as well as improved sarcomere assembly compared to muscles cultured alone. Finally, we performed microelectrode array measurements on neuronal cultures, which revealed that muscle-conditioned medium enhances overall neural firing rates and the emergence of synchronous bursting patterns. Overall, our study illustrates the significance of neuron-muscle cross talk for the in vitro development of neuromuscular bioactuators.

N2  - Understanding of the interactions of silver ions (Ag+) with polynucleotides is important not only to detect Ag+ over a wide range of concentrations in a simple, robust, and high-throughput manner but also to investigate the intermolecular interactions of hydrogen and coordinate interactions that are generated due to the interplay of Ag+, hydrogen ions (H+), and polynucleotides since it is critical to prevent adverse environmental effects that may cause DNA damage and develop strategies to treat this damage. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to simultaneously detect Ag+ satisfying the above requirements and examine the combined intermolecular interactions of Ag+-polycytosine and H+-polycytosine DNA complexes using dielectrophoretic tweezers-based force spectroscopy. For this investigation, we detected Ag+ over a range of concentrations (1 nM to 100 μM) by quantifying the rupture force of the combined interactions and examined the interplay between the three factors (Ag+, H+, and polycytosine) using the same assay for the detection of Ag+. Our study provides a new avenue not only for the detection of heavy metal ions but also for the investigation of heavy metal ions.polynucleotide DNA complexes using the same assay.

N2  - Methylation at the 5-carbon position of the cytosine nucleotide base in DNA has been shown to be a reliable diagnostic biomarker for carcinogenesis. Early detection of methylation and intervention could drastically increase the effectiveness of therapy and reduce the cancer mortality rate. Current methods for detecting methylation involve bisulfite genomic sequencing, which are cumbersome and demand a large sample size of bodily fluids to yield accurate results. Hence, more efficient and cost effective methods are desired. Based on our previous work, we present a novel nanopore-based assay using a nanopore in a MoS2 membrane, and the methyl-binding protein (MBP), MBD1x, to detect methylation on dsDNA. We show that the dsDNA translocation was effectively slowed down using an asymmetric concentration of buffer and explore the possibility of profiling the position of methylcytosines on the DNA strands as they translocate through the 2D membrane. Our findings advance us one step closer towards the possible use of nanopore sensing technology in medical applications such as cancer detection.

N2  - A novel bending stage is proposed to study the mechanical behavior of materials at small scale. The working principle of the stage is presented along with an experimental evidence using 3D printed prototype. The stage and the specimen are designed to be co-fabricated to avoid the specimen handling and misalignment problems. Analytical and numerical models of the stage are developed to predict the deflection and stresses in the specimen beam upon loading. Good agreement is found between the predictions from the two models. A stage and a sample are 3D printed with a plastic material (PA 2200) to test the feasibility of the proposed design. Bending test is carried out on the sample using the 3D printed stage. Elastic modulus of PA2200 is obtained from the load-deflection data. For comparison, uniaxial tension test was also performed on a PA2200 sample. The modulus of elasticity obtained by the two methods match with each other.

N2  - Background: The rapidly evolving discipline of biological and biomedical engineering requires adaptive instructional approaches that teach students to target and solve multi-pronged and ill-structured problems at the cutting edge of scientific research. Here we present a modular approach to designing a lab-based course in the emerging field of biofabrication and biological design, leading to a final capstone design project that requires students to formulate and test a hypothesis using the scientific method. Results: Students were assessed on a range of metrics designed to evaluate the format of the course, the efficacy of the format for teaching new topics and concepts, and the depth of the contribution this course made to students training for biological engineering careers. The evaluation showed that the problem-based format of the course was well suited to teaching students how to use the scientific method to investigate and uncover the fundamental biological design rules that govern the field of biofabrication. Conclusions: We show that this approach is an efficient and effective method of translating emergent scientific principles from the lab bench to the classroom and training the next generation of biological and biomedical engineers for careers as researchers and industry practicians.

N2  - Miniature organlike three-dimensional cell clusters often called organoids have emerged as a useful tool for both fundamental and applied bioscience studies. However, there is still a great need to improve the quality of organoids to a level where they exhibit similar biological functionality to an organ. To this end, we hypothesized that a decellularized matrix derived from mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) could regulate the phenotypic and metabolic activity of organoids. This hypothesis was examined by culturing cells of interest in the decellularized matrix of MSCs cultured on a 2D substrate at confluency or in the form of spheroids. The decellularized matrix prepared with MSC spheroids showed a 3D porous structure with a higher content of extracellular matrix molecules than the decellularized matrix derived from MSCs cultured on a 2D substrate. HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells, which retain the metabolic activity of hepatocytes, were cultured in these decellularized matrices. Interestingly, the decellularized matrix from the MSC spheroids served to develop the hepatic cell clusters with higher levels of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and detoxification activity than the decellularized matrix from the MSCs cultured on a 2D substrate. Overall, the results of this study are useful in improving biological functionality of a wide array of organoids.

N2  - A deeper understanding of biological materials and the design principles that govern them, combined with the enabling technology of 3D printing, has given rise to the idea of “building with biology.” Using these materials and tools, bio-hybrid robots or bio-bots, which adaptively sense and respond to their environment, can be manufactured. Skeletal muscle bioactuators are developed to power these bio-bots, and an approach is presented to make them dynamically responsive to changing environmental loads and robustly resilient to induced damage. Specifically, since the predominant cause of skeletal muscle loss of function is mechanical damage, the underlying mechanisms of damage are investigated in vitro, and an in vivo inspired healing strategy is developed to counteract this damage. The protocol that is developed yields complete recovery of healthy tissue functionality within two days of damage, setting the stage for a more robust, resilient, and adaptive bioactuator technology than previously demonstrated. Understanding and exploiting the adaptive response behaviors inherent within biological systems in this manner is a crucial step forward in designing bio-hybrid machines that are broadly applicable to grand engineering challenges.

In situ investigations of cell-extracellular mechanotransduction induced by cellular traction provide insights into the cytotoxicity of these same materials and of microcomponents formed with them using foundry-compatible processes, indicating potential cytotoxicity elicited by W at concentrations greater than 6 mM.

N2  - Three dimensional (3D) crumpling of two dimensional (2D) materials provides new opportunities to modulate mechanical, optical, surface, and chemical properties. However, investigation of the effect of 3D crumpling on 2D material liquid interaction has been limited. In this perspective, we will review crumple/texture induced heterogeneous surface properties including chemical modification, energy corrugation, and electronic structure perturbation which may modulate fluid interaction. We will then describe simulations of fluid interaction in systems resembling 3D textured 2D materials, principally nanotubes, which have begun to substantiate perturbations to fluid structure driven by texture induced modification of the 2D material surface. Furthermore, we will detail current experimental understanding of how texture induced modulation of interactions with pure solvent affect macroscale wetting characteristics including textured driven transitions in water contact from Wentzel to Cassie Baxter states. Following this discussion of how texturing affects the interaction of 2D materials with pure solvent, we will detail cutting edge explorations of how texturing modifies interaction with ions and other chemical species dispersed in solvent phases. Particular focus will be placed on recent simulations of aqueous phase molecular interaction with crumpled 2D materials which show that crumpling increases the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL) formed near a 2D material surface. This increased EDL thickness has allowed for the development of biomolecule sensors with gigantic sensitivity and the monitoring and templating of cells including neurons and myotubes. Sill, considerable work is needed to elucidate the effect of different crumpling geometries on the local properties of the full range of 2D materials, how these variation in local properties perturb fluid structure and molecular interaction, and how these tuned interactions enable diverse opportunities such as sensing, energy storage, and control of biological interaction.

N2  - It has long been known that neuronal axons are contractile. They actively maintain rest tension along the longitudinal direction both in vitro and in vivo. Here we show evidence that embryonic drosophila axons also actively maintain contractility/tension along the circumferential direction. We used confocal microscopy and spatial light interference microscopy to monitor axonal diameter along their length. We observed a decrease in diameter when microtubules are disrupted and an increase in diameter when actin filaments or myosin II are disrupted. Interestingly, active diameter reduction occurred consistently when axons were subjected to manipulations known to increase axial tension, suggesting that tension can be coupled in the axial and circumferential direction. This is further supported by the remarkably similar time constants for diameter reduction and rest tension increase of slackened axons. We infer that the actomyosin-driven circumferential contraction/hoop tension applies a squeezing force on the microtubule bundle of the axons. This hoop tension is balanced by the restoring force of the microtubule bundle. Therefore, axonal diameter increased when actin/myosin disrupting drugs relaxed the hoop tension and decreased when microtubule disrupting drug relaxed the restoring force. Circumferential tension thus can regulate axonal diameter and volume, as well as potentially microtubules alignment, inter-tubular spacing, and, by extension, axonal transport.

N2  - The distribution of single-cell properties across a population of cells can be measured using diverse tools, but no technology directly quantifies the biochemical stimulation events regulating these properties. Here we report digital counting of growth factors in single cells using fluorescent quantum dots and calibrated three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy (QDC-3DM) to reveal physiologically relevant cell stimulation distributions. We calibrate the fluorescence intensities of individual compact quantum dots labeled with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and demonstrate the necessity of near-infrared emission to overcome intrinsic cellular autofluoresence at the single-molecule level. When applied to human triple-negative breast cancer cells, we observe proportionality between stimulation and both receptor internalization and inhibitor response, reflecting stimulation heterogeneity contributions to intrinsic variability. We anticipate that QDC-3DM can be applied to analyze any peptidic ligand to reveal single-cell correlations between external stimulation and phenotypic variability, cell fate, and drug response.

N2  - Multiplexing is a method of analyzing multiple analytes in a biological assay in a single step. Multiplexing provides advantages of sample sparring, shorter time to result and reduce tests cost. To achieve multiplexing we have used barcoded particles which were fabricated by a Stop Flow Lithography process in a microfluidic environment. Here, we present a microfluidic system for electrical differentiation of barcoded particles and its sensitivity to enumerate blood cells. The barcoded particles conjugated with different sized microspheres simulating blood cells generated distinct electrical signatures when passed through a microfluidic coulter counter, highlighting its ability for multiplexed analyte quantification. Such multiplexing system can be used for detecting multiple diagnostics and prognostic biomarkers in diseases like Sepsis, Acute Kidney Injury, and AIDS diagnostic and management.

N2  - The recent interest in exploiting cadherin-derived fragments to mimic intercellular adhesion in engineered hybrid biomaterials raises questions about which cadherin constructs effectively mimic cadherin interactions. This study compared the biophysical properties of and signaling initiated by three different, immobilized N-cadherin-derived fragments, in order to identify a minimal construct that mimics intercellular adhesion in biomaterials. Specifically, we compared: i) the full N-cadherin extracellular region with all five ectodomains (EC1-5), ii) the first two ectodomains (EC1-2) of N-cadherin, and iii) a peptide containing the histidine-alanine-valine-aspartic acid-valine (HAVDI) sequence in the first extracellular domain. Comparisons of the binding kinetics and affinities between each of these ligands and N-cadherin expressed on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) revealed quantitative differences. Nevertheless, MSCs exhibited similar, rigidity-dependent spreading and traction forces when cultured on gels displaying any of these N-cadherin ligands. There were, however, differences in cell signaling and secretory activities. MSCs cultured on the full N-cadherin extracellular domain (EC1-5) exhibited stiffness-dependent changes in nuclear YAP/TAZ localization and significantly higher secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin growth factor 1, compared to cells cultured on hydrogels displaying either EC1-2 or the HAVDI peptide. The increased paracrine secretion also enhanced myogenic differentiation. These findings reveal functional differences between N-cadherin derived ligands important for the design of biomaterials that mimic intercellular adhesion.

N2  - Sepsis is a leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition to treat in U.S. hospitals. Despite targeted efforts to automate earlier detection of sepsis, current techniques rely exclusively on using either standard clinical data or novel biomarker measurements. In this study, we apply machine learning techniques to assess the predictive power of combining multiple biomarker measurements from a single blood sample with electronic medical record data (EMR) for the identification of patients in the early to peak phase of sepsis in a large community hospital setting. Combining biomarkers and EMR data achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.81, while EMR data alone achieved an AUC of 0.75. Furthermore, a single measurement of six biomarkers (IL-6, nCD64, IL-1ra, PCT, MCP1, and G-CSF) yielded the same predictive power as collecting an additional 16 hours of EMR data(AUC of 0.80), suggesting that the biomarkers may be useful for identifying these patients earlier. Ultimately, supervised learning using a subset of biomarker and EMR data as features may be capable of identifying patients in the early to peak phase of sepsis in a diverse population and may provide a tool for more timely identification and intervention.

N2  - The tumor microenvironment is implicated in orchestrating cancer cell transformation and metastasis. However, specific cell-ligand interactions between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix are difficult to decipher due to a dynamic and multivariate presentation of many signaling molecules. Here we report a versatile peptide microarray platform that is capable of screening for cancer cell phenotypic changes in response to ligand-receptor interactions. Using a screen of 78 peptide combinations derived from proteins present in the melanoma microenvironment, we identify a proteoglycan binding and bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7) derived sequence that selectively promotes the expression of several putative melanoma initiating cell markers. We characterize signaling associated with each of these peptides in the activation of melanoma pro-tumorigenic signaling and reveal a role for proteoglycan mediated adhesion and signaling through Smad 2/3. A defined substratum that controls the state of malignant melanoma may prove useful in spatially normalizing a heterogeneous population of tumor cells for discovery of therapeutics that target a specific state and for identifying new drug targets and reagents for intervention.

N2  - Behaviors, such as sleeping, foraging, and learning, are controlled by different regions of the rat brain, yet they occur rhythmically over the course of day and night. They are aligned adaptively with the day-night cycle by an endogenous circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but local mechanisms of rhythmic control are not established. The SCN expresses a ~24-hr oscillation in reduction-oxidation that modulates its own neuronal excitability. Could circadian redox oscillations control neuronal excitability elsewhere in the brain? We focused on the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus, which is known for integrating information as memories and where clock gene expression undergoes a circadian oscillation that is in anti-phase to the SCN. Evaluating long-term imaging of endogenous redox couples and biochemical determination of glutathiolation levels, we observed oscillations with a ~24 hr period that is 180° out-of-phase to the SCN. Excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, primary hippocampal projection neurons, also exhibits a rhythm in resting membrane potential that is circadian time-dependent and opposite from that of the SCN. The reducing reagent glutathione rapidly and reversibly depolarized the resting membrane potential of CA1 neurons; the magnitude is time-of-day-dependent and, again, opposite from the SCN. These findings extend circadian redox regulation of neuronal excitability from the SCN to the hippocampus. Insights into this system contribute to understanding hippocampal circadian processes, such as learning and memory, seizure susceptibility, and memory loss with aging.

N2  -                              Oxidation-reduction reactions are essential to life as the core mechanisms of energy transfer. A large body of evidence in recent years presents an extensive and complex network of interactions between the circadian and cellular redox systems. Recent advances show that cellular redox state undergoes a ~24-h (circadian) oscillation in most tissues and is conserved across the domains of life. In nucleated cells, the metabolic oscillation is dependent upon the circadian transcription-translation machinery and, vice versa, redox-active proteins and cofactors feed back into the molecular oscillator. In the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a hypothalamic region of the brain specialized for circadian timekeeping, redox oscillation was found to modulate neuronal membrane excitability. The SCN redox environment is relatively reduced in daytime when neuronal activity is highest and relatively oxidized in nighttime when activity is at its lowest. There is evidence that the redox environment directly modulates SCN K                             +                              channels, tightly coupling metabolic rhythms to neuronal activity. Application of reducing or oxidizing agents produces rapid changes in membrane excitability in a time-of-day-dependent manner. We propose that this reciprocal interaction may not be unique to the SCN. In this review, we consider the evidence for circadian redox oscillation and its interdependencies with established circadian timekeeping mechanisms. Furthermore, we will investigate the effects of redox on ion-channel gating dynamics and membrane excitability. The susceptibility of myriad different ion channels to modulation by changes in the redox environment suggests that circadian redox rhythms may play a role in the regulation of all excitable cells.

N2  - Recently, polymeric micelles self-assembled from amphiphilic polymers have been studied for various industrial and biomedical applications. This nanoparticle self-assembly typically occurs in a solvent-exchange process. In this process, the quality of the resulting particles is uncontrollably mediated by polymeric solubility and mixing conditions. Here, we hypothesized that improving the solubility of an amphiphilic polymer in an organic solvent via chemical modification while controlling the mixing rate of organic and aqueous phases would enhance control over particle morphology and size. We examined this hypothesis by synthesizing a poly(2-hydroxyethyl)aspartamide (PHEA) grafted with controlled numbers of octadecyl (C18) chains and oligovaline groups (termed "oligovaline-PHEA-C18"). The mixing rate of DMF and water was controlled either by microfluidic mixing of laminar DMF and water flows or through turbulent bulk mixing. Interestingly, oligovaline-PHEA-C18 exhibited an increased solubility in DMF compared with PHEA-C18, as demonstrated by an increase of mixing energy. In addition, increasing the mixing rate between water and DMF using the microfluidic mixer resulted in a decrease of the diameter of the resulting polymeric micelles, as compared with the particles formed from a bulk mixing process. Overall, these findings will expand the parameter space available to control particle self-assembly while also serving to improve existing nanoparticle processing techniques.

N2  - The use of biological field effect transistors (BioFETs) for the detection of biochemical events will yield new sensing systems that are smaller, less expensive, faster, and capable of multiplexing. Here, we present a novel massively parallel dual-gated BioFET (DG-BioFET) platform with over a million transistors in a 7 × 7 mm2 array that has all these benefits. Utilizing on-chip integrated circuits for row and column addressing and a PXI IC tester to measure signals, the drain current of each sensor in the 1024 × 1024 array is serially acquired in just 90 s. In this paper, we demonstrate that sensors in our massively parallel platform have standard transfer characteristics, high pH-sensitivity, and robust performance. In addition, we use the dual-gate operation and fast acquisition, unique in our platform, to improve the sensing performance of the system. We show that tailored biasing of the two DG-BioFET gates results in signal amplification above the Nernst limit (to 84 mV/pH) and redundancy techniques facilitate differential referencing, improving the resulting signal-to-noise ratio. Our platform encompasses the advantages of semiconductor-based biosensors, and demonstrates the benefits of high parallelism and FET dual-gate amplification for electrical and miniaturized biological sensing.

N2  - A centralized model predictive controller (MPC), which is unaware of local uncertainties, for an affine discrete time nonlinear system is presented. The local uncertainties are assumed to be matched, bounded and structured. In order to encounter disturbances and to improve performance, an adaptive control mechanism is employed locally. The proposed approach ensures input-to-state stability of closed-loop states and convergence to the equilibrium point. Moreover, uncertainties are learnt in terms of the given feature basis by using adaptive control mechanism. In addition, hard constraints on state and control are satisfied.

N2  - Recent studies have revealed the importance of outlier cells in complex cellular systems. Quantifying heterogeneity in such systems may lead to a better understanding of organ engineering, microtumor growth, and disease models, as well as more precise drug design. We used the ability of quantitative phase imaging to perform long-term imaging of cell growth to estimate the “influence” of cellular clusters on their neighbors. We validated our approach by analyzing epithelial and fibroblast cultures imaged over the course of several days. Interestingly, we found that there is a significant number of cells characterized by a medium correlation between their growth rate and distance (modulus of the Pearson coefficient between 0.25-.5). Furthermore, we found a small percentage of cells exhibiting strong such correlations, which we label as “influencer” cellular clusters. Our approach might find important applications in studying dynamic phenomena, such as organogenesis and metastasis.

N2  - Extracellular biophysical cues have a profound influence on a wide range of cell behaviors, including growth, motility, differentiation, apoptosis, gene expression, adhesion, and signal transduction. Cells not only respond to definitively mechanical cues from the extracellular matrix (ECM) but can also sometimes alter the mechanical properties of the matrix and hence influence subsequent matrix-based cues in both physiological and pathological processes. Interactions between cells and materials in vitro can modify cell phenotype and ECM structure, whether intentionally or inadvertently. Interactions between cell and matrix mechanics in vivo are of particular importance in a wide variety of disorders, including cancer, central nervous system injury, fibrotic diseases, and myocardial infarction. Both the in vitro and in vivo effects of this coupling between mechanics and biology hold important implications for clinical applications.

N2  - In order to fully understand brain connectivity and elucidate the mechanisms involved in central nervous system disease, the field of neuroscience depends on quantitative studies of neuronal structure and function. Cell morphology and neurite (axonal and dendritic) arborization are typically studied by immunohistochemical and fluorescence techniques. However, dry mass content and intracellular mass transport rates have largely been under-investigated given the inherent difficulties in their measurement. Here, spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) and dispersion-relation phase spectroscopy (DPS) were used to measure pathlength fluctuations that report on the dry mass and transport within cultured primary neurons across low, medium, and high cell density conditions. It was found that cell density (confluence) affects significantly both the growth rate and mass transport. The analysis method is label-free and does not require neuronal tracing, particle tracking, or neuron reconstruction. Since SLIM can upgrade any existing phase contrast microscope and the imaging and analysis are high-throughput, we anticipate that this approach will be embraced by neuroscientists for broad scale studies.
AB  - In order to fully understand brain connectivity and elucidate the mechanisms involved in central nervous system disease, the field of neuroscience depends on quantitative studies of neuronal structure and function. Cell morphology and neurite (axonal and dendritic) arborization are typically studied by immunohistochemical and fluorescence techniques. However, dry mass content and intracellular mass transport rates have largely been under-investigated given the inherent difficulties in their measurement. Here, spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) and dispersion-relation phase spectroscopy (DPS) were used to measure pathlength fluctuations that report on the dry mass and transport within cultured primary neurons across low, medium, and high cell density conditions. It was found that cell density (confluence) affects significantly both the growth rate and mass transport. The analysis method is label-free and does not require neuronal tracing, particle tracking, or neuron reconstruction. Since SLIM can upgrade any existing phase contrast microscope and the imaging and analysis are high-throughput, we anticipate that this approach will be embraced by neuroscientists for broad scale studies.

N2  - Fibrin gels have been extensively used for three-dimensional cell culture, bleeding control, and molecular and cell therapies because the fibrous networks facilitate biomolecular and cell transport. However, a small window for gelation makes it difficult to handle the gels for desired preparation and transport. Several methods developed to control gelation rates often alter the microstructure, thereby affecting the mechanical response. We hypothesized that a particle designed to discharge thrombin cargos in response to an external stimulus, such as H2O2, would provide control of the gelation rate over a broad range while strengthening the gel. We examined this hypothesis by assembling poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles loaded with thrombin and MnO2 nanosheets that decompose H2O2 to O2 gas. The resulting particles named as catalytic microgelator were mixed with fibrinogen solution or blood containing 0.2 mM H2O2. Due to the increased internal pressure, these particles released a 3-fold larger mass of thrombin than PLGA particles loaded only with thrombin. As a consequence, catalytic microgelators increased the gelation time by one order of magnitude and the elastic modulus by a factor of two compared with the fibrin gel formed by directly mixing fibrinogen and thrombin in solution. These catalytic microgelators also served to clot blood, unlike PLGA particles loaded with thrombin. The resulting blood clot was also more rigid than the blood clot formed by thrombin solution. The results of this study would serve as a new paradigm in controlling gelation kinetics of pre-gel solution and mechanical properties of the post-gel matrix.

N2  - Cancer cell invasion through physical barriers in the extracellular matrix (ECM) requires a complex synergy of traction force against the ECM, mechanosensitive feedback, and subsequent cytoskeletal rearrangement. PDMS microchannels were used to investigate the transition from mesenchymal to amoeboid invasion in cancer cells. Migration was faster in narrow 3 μm-wide channels than in wider 10 μm channels, even in the absence of cell-binding ECM proteins. Cells permeating narrow channels exhibited blebbing and had smooth leading edge profiles, suggesting an ECM-induced transition from mesenchymal invasion to amoeboid invasion. Live cell labeling revealed a mechanosensing period in which the cell attempts mesenchymal-based migration, reorganizes its cytoskeleton, and proceeds using an amoeboid phenotype. Rho/ROCK (amoeboid) and Rac (mesenchymal) pathway inhibition revealed that amoeboid invasion through confined environments relies on both pathways in a time- and ECM-dependent manner. This demonstrates that cancer cells can dynamically modify their invasion programming to navigate physically confining matrix conditions.

N2  - A systems approach to regulation of neuronal excitation in the mollusc Pleurobranchaea has described novel interactions of cyclic AMP-gated cation current (INa,cAMP), Ca2+, pHi, and NO. INa,cAMP appears in many neurons of feeding and locomotor neuronal networks. It is likely one of the family of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic-nucleotide-gated currents (h-current) of vertebrate and invertebrate pacemaker networks. There are two isoforms. Ca2+ regulates both voltage dependence and depolarization-sensitive inactivation in both isoforms. The Type 1 INa,cAMP of the feeding network is enhanced by intracellular acidification. A direct dependence of INa,cAMP on cAMP allows the current to be used as a reporter on cAMP concentrations in the cell, and from there to the intrinsic activities of the synthetic adenyl cyclase and the degradative phosphodiesterase. Type 2 INa,cAMP of the locomotor system is activated by serotonergic inputs, while Type 1 of the feeding network is thought to be regulated peptidergically. NO synthase activity is high in the CNS, where it differs from standard neuronal NO synthase in not being Ca2+ sensitive. NO acidifies pHi, potentiating Type 1, and may act to open proton channels. A cGMP pathway does not mediate NO effects as in other systems. Rather, nitrosylation likely mediates its actions. An integrated model of the action of cAMP, Ca2+, pHi, and NO in the feeding network postulates that NO regulates proton conductance to cause neuronal excitation in the cell body on the one hand, and relief of activity-induced hyperacidification in fine dendritic processes on the other.

N2  - Phase-contrast microscopy converts the phase shift of light passing through a transparent specimen, e.g., a biological cell, into brightness variations in an image. This ability to observe structures without destructive fixation or staining has been widely utilized for applications in materials and life sciences. Despite these advantages, phase-contrast microscopy lacks the ability to reveal molecular information. To address this gap, we developed a bond-selective transient phase (BSTP) imaging technique that excites molecular vibrations by infrared light, resulting in a transient change in phase shift that can be detected by a diffraction phase microscope. By developing a time-gated pump–probe camera system, we demonstrate BSTP imaging of live cells at a 50 Hz frame rate with high spectral fidelity, sub-microsecond temporal resolution, and sub-micron spatial resolution. Our approach paves a new way for spectroscopic imaging investigation in biology and materials science.

N2  - The role of tumor microenvironment in cancer progression is gaining significant attention. It is realized that cancer cells and the corresponding stroma co-evolve with time. Cancer cells recruit and transform the stromal cells, which in turn remodel the extra cellular matrix of the stroma. This complex interaction between the stroma and the cancer cells results in a dynamic feed-forward/feed-back loop with biochemical and biophysical cues that assist metastatic transition of the cancer cells. Although biochemistry has long been studied for the understanding of cancer progression, biophysical signaling is emerging as a critical paradigm determining cancer metastasis. In this mini review, we discuss the role of one of the biophysical cues, mostly the mechanical stiffness of tumor microenvironment, in cancer progression and its clinical implications.

N2  - As they differentiate from neuroblasts, nascent neurons become highly polarized and elongate. Neurons extend and elaborate fine and fragile cellular extensions that form circuits enabling long-distance communication and signal integration within the body. While other organ systems are developing, projections of differentiating neurons find paths to distant targets. Subsequent post-developmental neuronal damage is catastrophic because the cues for reinnervation are no longer active. Advances in biomaterials are enabling fabrication of micro-environments that encourage neuronal regrowth and restoration of function by recreating these developmental cues. This mini-review considers new materials that employ topographical, chemical, electrical, and/or mechanical cues for use in neuronal repair. Manipulating and integrating these elements in different combinations will generate new technologies to enhance neural repair.

N2  - Pumps are critical life-sustaining components for all animals. At the earliest stages of life, the tubular embryonic heart works as a valveless pump capable of generating unidirectional blood flow. Inspired by this elementary pump, we developed an example of a biohybrid valveless pump-bot powered by engineered skeletal muscle. Our pump-bot consists of a soft hydrogel tube connected at both ends to a stiffer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) scaffold, creating an impedance mismatch. A contractile muscle ring wraps around the hydrogel tube at an off-center location, squeezing the tube with or without buckling it locally. Cyclic muscle contractions, spontaneous or electrically stimulated, further squeeze the tube, resulting in elastic waves that propagate along the soft tube and get reflected back at the soft/stiff tube boundaries. Asymmetric placement of muscle ring results in a time delay between the wave arrivals, thus establishing a net unidirectional fluid flow irrespective of whether the tube is buckled or not. Flow rates of up to 22.5 μL/min are achieved by the present pump-bot, which are at least three orders of magnitude higher than those from cardiomyocyte-powered valve pumps of similar size. Owning to its simple geometry, robustness, ease of fabrication, and high pumping performance, our pump-bot is particularly well-suited for a wide range of biomedical applications in microfluidics, drug delivery, biomedical devices, cardiovascular pumping system, and more.

N2  - Actuation is essential for artificial machines to interact with their surrounding environment and to accomplish the functions for which they are designed. Over the past few decades, there has been considerable progress in developing new actuation technologies. However, controlled motion still represents a considerable bottleneck for many applications and hampers the development of advanced robots, especially at small length scales. Nature has solved this problem using molecular motors that, through living cells, are assembled into multiscale ensembles with integrated control systems. These systems can scale force production from piconewtons up to kilonewtons. By leveraging the performance of living cells and tissues and directly interfacing them with artificial components, it should be possible to exploit the intricacy and metabolic efficiency of biological actuation within artificial machines. We provide a survey of important advances in this biohybrid actuation paradigm.

N2  - Bioresorbable electronic materials serve as foundations for implantable devices that provide active diagnostic or therapeutic function over a timeframe matched to a biological process, and then disappear within the body to avoid secondary surgical extraction. Approaches to power supply in these physically transient systems are critically important. This paper describes a fully biodegradable, monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) platform based on microscale cells (microcells) designed to operate at wavelengths with long penetration depths in biological tissues (red and near infrared wavelengths), such that external illumination can provide realistic levels of power. Systematic characterization and theoretical simulations of operation under porcine skin and fat establish a foundational understanding of these systems and their scalability. In vivo studies of a representative platform capable of generating ≈60 µW of electrical power under 4 mm of porcine skin and fat illustrate an ability to operate blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as subdermal implants in rats for 3 d. Here, the PV system fully resorbs after 4 months. Histological analysis reveals that the degradation process introduces no inflammatory responses in the surrounding tissues. The results suggest the potential for using silicon photovoltaic microcells as bioresorbable power supplies for various transient biomedical implants.

N2  - The direct quantification of weak intermolecular binding interactions is very important for many applications in biology and medicine. Techniques that can be used to investigate such interactions under a controlled environment, while varying different parameters such as loading rate, pulling direction, rupture event measurements, and the use of different functionalized probes, are still lacking. Herein, we demonstrate a biaxial dielectrophoresis force spectroscopy (BDFS) method that can be used to investigate weak unbinding events in a high-throughput manner under controlled environments and by varying the pulling direction (i.e., transverse and/or vertical axes) as well as the loading rate. With the BDFS system, we can quantitatively analyze binding interactions related to hydrogen bonding or ionic attractions between functionalized microbeads and a surface within a microfluidic device. Our BDFS system allowed for the characterization of the number of bonds involved in an interaction, bond affinity, kinetic rates, and energy barrier heights and widths from different regimes of the energy landscape.

N2  - Extensive efforts have been made to regulate surface wettability using bivalent polymers composed of hydrophobic surface-reactive groups and hydrophilic groups. To further enhance the controllability, this study demonstrates that the balance between the surface reactivity and self-aggregation of bivalent poly(hydroxyethyl-co-methacryloxyethyl aspartamide) (PHMAA) is crucial in controlling the wettability of methacrylated glass and thus the adhesion of stem cells. In particular, the wettability of the glass and the subsequent cell spreading became maximal with PHMAA that led to the largest and most uniform coverage of hydroxyl groups. In summary, this study would be useful in advancing various molecules used for surface engineering.

N2  - The current tissue evaluation method for breast cancer would greatly benefit from higher throughput and less inter-observer variation. Since quantitative phase imaging (QPI) measures physical parameters of tissue, it can be used to find quantitative markers, eliminating observer subjectivity. Furthermore, since the pixel values in QPI remain the same regardless of the instrument used, classifiers can be built to segment various tissue components without need for color calibration. In this work we use a texton-based approach to segment QPI images of breast tissue into various tissue components (epithelium, stroma or lumen). A tissue microarray comprising of 900 unstained cores from 400 different patients was imaged using Spatial Light Interference Microscopy. The training data were generated by manually segmenting the images for 36 cores and labelling each pixel (epithelium, stroma or lumen.). For each pixel in the data, a response vector was generated by the Leung-Malik (LM) filter bank and these responses were clustered using the k-means algorithm to find the centers (called textons). A random forest classifier was then trained to find the relationship between a pixel's label and the histogram of these textons in that pixel's neighborhood. The segmentation was carried out on the validation set by calculating the texton histogram in a pixel's neighborhood and generating a label based on the model learnt during training. Segmentation of the tissue into various components is an important step toward efficiently computing parameters that are markers of disease. Automated segmentation, followed by diagnosis, can improve the accuracy and speed of analysis leading to better health outcomes.

N2  - In this paper, we present an updated automatic diagnostic procedure for prostate cancer using quantitative phase imaging (QPI). In a recent report [1], we demonstrated the use of Random Forest for image segmentation on prostate cores imaged using QPI. Based on these label maps, we developed an algorithm to discriminate between regions with Gleason grade 3 and 4 prostate cancer in prostatectomy tissue. The Area-Under-Curve (AUC) of 0.79 for the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) can be obtained for Gleason grade 4 detection in a binary classification between Grade 3 and Grade 4. Our dataset includes 280 benign cases and 141 malignant cases. We show that textural features in phase maps have strong diagnostic values since they can be used in combination with the label map to detect presence or absence of basal cells, which is a strong indicator for prostate carcinoma. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on this new feature vector can classify cancer/non-cancer with an error rate of 0.23 and an AUC value of 0.83.

N2  - The original version of this Article contained an error in the Abstract. “Cell velocity in the highly metastatic population shows a relative insensitivity to matrix stiffness”. now reads: “Cell velocity in the highly metastatic population shows a relative stability at higher matrix stiffness”. Additionally, this Article contained an error in Figure 2, where panel (c) used incorrect units. Furthermore, this Article contained errors in the Results section. “At lower stiffness of 10 kPa and 40 kPa, the more metastatic B16 F10 had a significantly higher dry mass growth rate of 1092 pg/hr and 1157 pg/hr, respectively, as compared to the less metastatic B16 F0, which had a dry mass growth rate of 641 pg/hr and 930 pg/hr, respectively (p = 0.00086). At the higher stiffness of 100 kPa, B16 F0 had similar dry mass growth to the lower stiffnesses at 880 pg/hr (Fig. S3), whereas B16 F10 decreased to 740 pg/ hr (p = 0.27).” now reads: “At lower stiffness of 10 kPa and 40 kPa, the more metastatic B16 F10 had a significantly higher dry mass growth rate of 109.2 pg/hr and 115.7 pg/hr, respectively, as compared to the less metastatic B16 F0, which had a dry mass growth rate of 64.1 pg/hr and 93.0 pg/hr, respectively (p = 0.00086). At the higher stiffness of 100 kPa, B16 F0 had similar dry mass growth to the lower stiffnesses at 88.0 pg/hr (Fig. S3), whereas B16 F10 decreased to 74.0 pg/hr (p = 0.27).” “On average, the more metastatic B16 F10 cells had similar VDW of 2.43 µm/hr, 2.28 µm/hr, and 2.06 µm/hr at 10 kPa, 40 kPa, and 100 kPa, respectively, indicating that stiffness has little influence on B16 F10 migration velocity (Fig. 3B). In contrast, stiffness plays a pronounced role in the migration profile of the less metastatic B16 F0. While B16 F0 had a VWD of 1.74 µm/hr and 1.56 µm/hr at the lower stiffnesses of 10 kPa and 40 kPa, VDW increased to 2.01 µm/hr at 100 kPa.” now reads: “On average, the more metastatic B16 F10 cells had VDWs of 5.2 µm/hr, 4.0 µm/hr, and 3.5 µm/hr at 10 kPa, 40 kPa, and 100 kPa, respectively, indicating that lower stiffness has some influence on B16 F10 migration velocity (Fig. 3B). As well, stiffness plays a role in the migration profile of the less metastatic B16 F0. While B16 F0 had a VWD of 2.5 µm/hr and 3 µm/hr at the lower stiffnesses of 10 kPa and 40 kPa, VDW increased to 3.5 µm/ hr at 100 kPa.” Finally, this Article contained an error in the Conclusion section. “In addition, high metastatic potential corresponds with higher migration profiles, as determined by the velocity width distribution, which was relatively insensitive to changes in stiffness.” now reads: “In addition, high metastatic potential corresponds with higher migration profiles, as determined by the velocity width distribution, which did not increase with increasing stiffness.” These errors have now been corrected in the PDF and HTML versions of the Article.
AB  - The original version of this Article contained an error in the Abstract. “Cell velocity in the highly metastatic population shows a relative insensitivity to matrix stiffness”. now reads: “Cell velocity in the highly metastatic population shows a relative stability at higher matrix stiffness”. Additionally, this Article contained an error in Figure 2, where panel (c) used incorrect units. Furthermore, this Article contained errors in the Results section. “At lower stiffness of 10 kPa and 40 kPa, the more metastatic B16 F10 had a significantly higher dry mass growth rate of 1092 pg/hr and 1157 pg/hr, respectively, as compared to the less metastatic B16 F0, which had a dry mass growth rate of 641 pg/hr and 930 pg/hr, respectively (p = 0.00086). At the higher stiffness of 100 kPa, B16 F0 had similar dry mass growth to the lower stiffnesses at 880 pg/hr (Fig. S3), whereas B16 F10 decreased to 740 pg/ hr (p = 0.27).” now reads: “At lower stiffness of 10 kPa and 40 kPa, the more metastatic B16 F10 had a significantly higher dry mass growth rate of 109.2 pg/hr and 115.7 pg/hr, respectively, as compared to the less metastatic B16 F0, which had a dry mass growth rate of 64.1 pg/hr and 93.0 pg/hr, respectively (p = 0.00086). At the higher stiffness of 100 kPa, B16 F0 had similar dry mass growth to the lower stiffnesses at 88.0 pg/hr (Fig. S3), whereas B16 F10 decreased to 74.0 pg/hr (p = 0.27).” “On average, the more metastatic B16 F10 cells had similar VDW of 2.43 µm/hr, 2.28 µm/hr, and 2.06 µm/hr at 10 kPa, 40 kPa, and 100 kPa, respectively, indicating that stiffness has little influence on B16 F10 migration velocity (Fig. 3B). In contrast, stiffness plays a pronounced role in the migration profile of the less metastatic B16 F0. While B16 F0 had a VWD of 1.74 µm/hr and 1.56 µm/hr at the lower stiffnesses of 10 kPa and 40 kPa, VDW increased to 2.01 µm/hr at 100 kPa.” now reads: “On average, the more metastatic B16 F10 cells had VDWs of 5.2 µm/hr, 4.0 µm/hr, and 3.5 µm/hr at 10 kPa, 40 kPa, and 100 kPa, respectively, indicating that lower stiffness has some influence on B16 F10 migration velocity (Fig. 3B). As well, stiffness plays a role in the migration profile of the less metastatic B16 F0. While B16 F0 had a VWD of 2.5 µm/hr and 3 µm/hr at the lower stiffnesses of 10 kPa and 40 kPa, VDW increased to 3.5 µm/ hr at 100 kPa.” Finally, this Article contained an error in the Conclusion section. “In addition, high metastatic potential corresponds with higher migration profiles, as determined by the velocity width distribution, which was relatively insensitive to changes in stiffness.” now reads: “In addition, high metastatic potential corresponds with higher migration profiles, as determined by the velocity width distribution, which did not increase with increasing stiffness.” These errors have now been corrected in the PDF and HTML versions of the Article.

N2  - Cancer metastasis has been believed as a genetically programmed process that is commonly marked by biochemical signals. Here using extracellular matrix control of cellular mechanics, we establish that cellular force threshold can also mark in vitro metastatic phenotypic change and malignant transformation in HCT-8 cell colonies. We observe that for prolonged culture time the HCT-8 cell colonies disperse into individual malignant cells, and the metastatic-like dispersion depends on both cell-seeding gel stiffness and colony size. Cellular force microscopies show that gel stiffness and colony size are also two key parameters that modulate cellular forces, suggesting the correlations between the cellular forces and the metastatic phenotypic change. Using our recently developed biophysical model, we construct an extracellular traction phase diagram in the stiffness-size space, filled with experimental data on the colony behavior. From the phase diagram we identify a phase boundary as a traction force threshold above which the metastatic phenotypic transition occurs and below which the cell colonies remain cohesive. Our finding suggests that the traction threshold can be regarded as an effective mechano-marker for the onset of the metastatic-like dispersion and malignant transformation.

N2  - Microfluidic devices have extensively been applied to study biological samples, including single cells. Exploiting laminar flows on a small scale, microfluidics allow for the selective and partial exposure of samples to various chemical treatments. Traditionally, suspendable samples are first flowed into formed microchannels and are allowed to adhere to the channel floor randomly with no control over sample placement or orientation, before being subjected to partial treatment. This severely limits the choice of samples and the extent of sample preparations. Here, we overcame this limit by reversing the sequence. We prepared the samples first on glass substrates. A patterned silicone slab was then placed on the substrate to form channels at an appropriate orientation with respect to the sample. We used liquid silicone rubber (LSR) as the base material. Its compliance (low elastic modulus) and its adhesion to glass offer the necessary seal to form the microchannels naturally. The applicability of the device was demonstrated by testing single axons of embryonic Drosophila motor neurons in vivo. A segment of the axons was subjected to drugs that inhibit myosin activities or block voltage-gated sodium ion channels. In response, the axons reduced the clustering of neuro-transmitter vesicles at the presynaptic terminal of neuromuscular junctions, or increased the calcium intake and underwent membrane hyperpolarization, respectively. Such fundamental studies cannot be carried out using conventional microfluidics.

N2  - Extracellular potassium concentration affects the membrane potential of neurons, and, thus, neuronal activity. Indeed, alterations of potassium levels can be related to neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and, therefore, selectively detecting extracellular potassium would allow the monitoring of disease. However, currently available optical reporters are not capable of detecting small changes in potassium, in particular, in freely moving animals. Furthermore, they are susceptible to interference from sodium ions. Here, we report a highly sensitive and specific potassium nanosensor that can monitor potassium changes in the brain of freely moving mice undergoing epileptic seizures. An optical potassium indicator is embedded in mesoporous silica nanoparticles, which are shielded by an ultrathin layer of a potassium-permeable membrane, which prevents diffusion of other cations and allows the specific capturing of potassium ions. The shielded nanosensor enables the spatial mapping of potassium ion release in the hippocampus of freely moving mice.

N2  - Diverse biological systems utilize fluctuations (“noise”) in gene expression to drive lineage-commitment decisions. However, once a commitment is made, noise becomes detrimental to reliable function, and the mechanisms enabling post-commitment noise suppression are unclear. Here, we find that architectural constraints on noise suppression are overcome to stabilize fate commitment. Using single-molecule and time-lapse imaging, we find that—after a noise-driven event—human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strongly attenuates expression noise through a non-transcriptional negative-feedback circuit. Feedback is established through a serial cascade of post-transcriptional splicing, whereby proteins generated from spliced mRNAs auto-deplete their own precursor unspliced mRNAs. Strikingly, this auto-depletion circuitry minimizes noise to stabilize HIV's commitment decision, and a noise-suppression molecule promotes stabilization. This feedback mechanism for noise suppression suggests a functional role for delayed splicing in other systems and may represent a generalizable architecture of diverse homeostatic signaling circuits. Noise helps drive fate decisions, and a mechanism rooted in alternative splicing allows cells to stop dithering and commit.

N2  - Quantitative assessment of soft tissue elasticity is crucial to a broad range of applications, such as biomechanical modeling, physiological monitoring, and tissue diseases diagnosing. However, the modulus measurement of soft tissues, particularly in vivo, has proved challenging since the instrument has to reach the site of soft tissue and be able to measure in a very short time. Here, we present a simple method to measure the elastic modulus of soft tissues on site by exploiting buckling of a long slender bar to quantify the applied force and a spherical indentation to extract the elastic modulus. The method is realized by developing a portable pen-sized instrument (EPen: Elastic modulus pen). The measurement accuracies are verified by independent modulus measures using commercial nanoindenter. Quantitative measurements of the elastic modulus of mouse pancreas, healthy and cancerous, surgically exposed but attached to the body further confirm the potential clinical utility of the EPen.

N2  - Sepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection, has the highest burden of death and medical expenses in hospitals worldwide. Leukocyte count and CD64 expression on neutrophils (nCD64) are known to correlate strongly with improved sensitivity and specificity of sepsis diagnosis at its onset. A major challenge is the lack of a rapid and accurate point-of-care (PoC) device that can perform these measurements from a minute blood sample. Here, we report a PoC microfluidic biochip to enumerate leukocytes and quantify nCD64 levels from 10 μl of whole blood without any manual processing. Biochip measurements have shown excellent correlation with the results from flow cytometer. In clinical studies, we have used PoC biochip to monitor leukocyte counts and nCD64 levels from patients' blood at different times of their stay in the hospital. Furthermore, we have shown the biochip's utility for improved sepsis diagnosis by combining these measurements with electronic medical record (EMR).

N2  - We introduce a novel method to form 3D biomimetic tissues from a droplet of a cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) mixture on a sensor stage and to quantify tissue force and stiffness as a function of time under optical microscopes. This method exploits advances in micro-nano fabrication and capillarity for self-assembly and self-alignment of tissues on the stage. It allows simultaneous investigation of the microstructure of the tissue in situ while its mechanical response is quantified, thus linking tissue biophysics with physiology and revealing structural-functional properties of 3D tissues. We demonstrate the functionality of the stage by studying the mechanical behavior of different cell-collagen mixtures under mechanical, chemical and electrical stimulation. This includes force evolution in cell-free collagen during curing, myotubes differentiated from muscle cell-collagen/Matrigel ECM subjected to electrical stimulation, and fibroblast-collagen tissue subjected to cancer cell conditioned media (CM) and a Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y27632. Muscle contraction decreases with increasing frequency of electrical stimulation, and fibroblasts respond to CM by increasing contractility for a short time and completely relax in the presence of Y27632 but restore force with Y27632 washout.

N2  - We present a novel silicon MEMS stage for in-situ bending test of micro/nanoscale samples at high temperature. The stage minimizes uniaxial state of stress in the sample, but maximizes the bending stress over a small volume such that high stresses can be reached without a premature failure by flaw induced fracture. A test setup is designed to carry the stage inside an SEM which enables to heat the sample up to 450 °C. A piezoactuator of the setup stretches the stage which translates into bending the sample. Sample is co-fabricated with the stage to avoid handling and misalignment problems. Analytical and finite element (FE) models are developed to predict the behavior of the bending stage and calculate the stresses in the sample. Single crystal silicon (SCS) micro-beams oriented along [0 1 1] are tested at room temperature under bending. They showed higher strength compared to the uniaxial tension test results. The calculated modulus of elasticity of the samples matches the value reported in literature. In addition samples with thickness 2–5μm exhibited brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) at 400 °C, about 150 °C below the bulk BDT temperature.

N2  - Biological machines consisting of cells and biomaterials have the potential to dynamically sense, process, respond, and adapt to environmental signals in real time. As a first step toward the realization of such machines, which will require biological actuators that can generate force and perform mechanical work, we have developed a method of manufacturing modular skeletal muscle actuators that can generate up to 1.7 μN(3.2 kPa) of passive tension force and 300 mN(0.56 kPa) of active tension force in response to external stimulation. Such millimeter-scale biological actuators can be coupled to a wide variety of 3D-printed skeletons to power complex output behaviors such as controllable locomotion. This article provides a comprehensive protocol for forward engineering of biological actuators and 3D-printed skeletons for any design application. 3D printing of the injection molds and skeletons requires 3 h, seeding the muscle actuators takes 2 h, and differentiating the muscle takes 7 d.

N2  - Antigen expression is an important biomarker for cell analysis and disease diagnosis. Traditionally, antigen expression is measured using a flow cytometer which, due to its cost and labor intensive sample preparation, is unsuitable to be used at the point-of-care. Therefore, an automatic, miniaturized assay which can measure antigen expression in the patient could aid in making crucial clinical decisions rapidly. Such a device would also expand the use of such an assay in basic research in biology. In this paper, we present a microfluidic device that can be used to measure antigen expression on cells. We demonstrate our approach using biotin-neutravidin as the binding pair using experimental and computational approaches. We flow beads with varying biotin surface densities (mr) through a polydimethylsiloxane channel with cylindrical pillars functionalized with neutravidin. We analyze how shear stress and collision angle, the angle at which the beads collide with the pillars, affect the angular location of beads captured on the pillars. We also find that the fraction of captured beads as a function of distance (γ) in the channel is affected by mr. Using γ, we derive the probability of capture per collision with the pillar (ϵ). We show that ϵ is linearly related to mr, which is analogous to the expression level of proteins on cell surfaces. Although demonstrated with beads, this assay can next be expanded with cells, thus paving the way for a rapid antigen expression test.

N2  - Sepsis, an adverse auto-immune response to an infection often causing life-threatening complications, results in the highest mortality and treatment cost of any illness in US hospitals. Several immune biomarker levels, including Interleukin 6 (IL-6), have shown a high correlation to the onset and progression of sepsis. Currently, no technology diagnoses and stratifies sepsis progression using biomarker levels. This paper reports a microfluidic biochip platform to detect proteins in undiluted human plasma samples. The device uses a differential enumeration platform that integrates Coulter counting principles, antigen specific capture chambers, and micro size bead based immunodetection to quantify cytokines. This microfluidic biochip was validated as a potential point of care technology by quantifying IL-6 from plasma samples (n = 29) with good correlation (R2 = 0.81) and agreement (Bland-Altman) compared to controls. In combination with previous applications, this point of care platform can potentially detect cell and protein biomarkers simultaneously for sepsis stratification.

N2  - Directing neurons to form predetermined circuits with the intention of treating neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases is a fundamental goal and current challenge in neuroengineering. Until recently, only neuronal aggregates were studied and characterized in culture, which can limit information gathered to populations of cells. In this study, we use a substrate constructed of arrays of strain-induced self-rolled-up membrane 3D architectures. This results in changes in the neuronal architecture and altered growth dynamics of neurites. Hippocampal neurons from postnatal rats were cultured at low confluency (∼250 cells mm-2) on an array of transparent rolled-up microtubes (μ-tubes; 4-5 μm diameter) of varying topographical arrangements. Neurite growth on the μ-tubes was characterized and compared to controls in order to establish a baseline for alignment imposed by the topography. Compared to control substrates, neurites are significantly more aligned toward the 0° reference on the μ-tube array. Pitch (20-60 and 100 μm) and μ-tube length (30-80 μm) of array elements were also varied to investigate their impact on neurite alignment. We found that alignment was improved by the gradient pitch arrangement and with longer μ-tubes. Application of this technology will enhance the ability to construct intentional neural circuits through array design and manipulation of individual neurons and can be adapted to address challenges in neural repair, reinnervation, and neuroregeneration.

N2  - Ever since proangiogenic growth factors have been used as a vascular medicine to treat tissue ischemia, efforts have been increasingly made to develop a method to enhance efficacy of growth factors in recreating microvascular networks, especially at low dose. To this end, we hypothesized that polysaccharides substituted with sulfate groups would amplify growth factor receptor activation and stimulate phenotypic activities of endothelial cells involved in neovascularization. We examined this hypothesis by modifying alginate with a controlled number of sulfates and using it to derive a complex with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as confirmed with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Compared with the bare VEGF and with a mixture of VEGF and unmodified alginates, the VEGF complexed with alginate sulfates significantly reduced the dissociation rate with the VEGFR-2, elevated VEGFR-2 phosphorylation level, and increased the number of endothelial sprouts in vitro. Furthermore, the VEGF-alginate sulfate complex improved recovery of perfusion in an ischemic hindlimb of a mouse due to the increase of the capillary density. Overall, this study not only demonstrates an important cofactor of VEGF but also uncovers an underlying mechanism by which the cofactor mitigates the VEGF-induced signaling involved in the binding kinetics and activation of VEGFR. We therefore believe that the results of this study will be highly useful in improving the therapeutic efficacy of various growth factors and expediting their uses in clinical treatments of wounds and tissue defects.

N2  - Overproduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) are closely related to various health problems including inflammation, infection, and cancer. Abnormally high ROS levels can cause serious oxidative damage to biomolecules, cells, and tissues. A series of nano- or microsized particles has been developed to reduce the oxidative stress level by delivering antioxidant drugs. However, most systems are often plagued by slow molecular discharge, driven by diffusion. Herein, this study demonstrates the polymeric particles whose internal pressure can increase upon exposure to H2O2, one of the ROS, and in turn, discharge antioxidants actively. The on-demand pressurized particles are assembled by simultaneously encapsulating water-dispersible manganese oxide (MnO2) nanosheets and green tea derived epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) molecules into a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) spherical shell. In the presence of H2O2, the MnO2 nanosheets in the PLGA particle generate oxygen gas by decomposing H2O2 and increase the internal pressure. The pressurized PLGA particles release antioxidative EGCG actively and, in turn, protect vascular and brain tissues from oxidative damage more effectively than the particles without MnO2 nanosheets. This H2O2 responsive, self-pressurizing particle system would be useful to deliver a wide array of molecular cargos in response to the oxidation level.

N2  - Axons of neurons are contractile, i.e., they actively maintain a rest tension. However, the spatial origin of this contractility along the axon and the role of the cytoskeleton in generating tension and sustaining rigidity are unknown. Here, using a microfluidic platform, we exposed a small segment of the axons of embryonic Drosophila motor neurons to specific cytoskeletal disruption drugs. We observed that a local actomyosin disruption led to a total loss in axonal tension, with the stiffness of the axon remaining unchanged. A local disruption of microtubules led to a local reduction in bending stiffness, while tension remained unchanged. These observations demonstrated that contractile forces are generated and transferred along the entire length of the axon in a serial fashion. Thus, a local force disruption results in a collapse of tension of the entire axon. This mechanism potentially provides a pathway for rapid tension regulation to facilitate physiological processes that are influenced by axonal tension.

N2  - Surgeons typically rely on their past training and experiences as well as visual aids from medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) for the planning of surgical processes. Often, due to the anatomical complexity of the surgery site, two dimensional or virtual images are not sufficient to successfully convey the structural details. For such scenarios, a 3D printed model of the patient’s anatomy enables personalized preoperative planning. This paper reviews critical aspects of 3D printing for preoperative planning and surgical training, starting with an overview of the process-flow and 3D printing techniques, followed by their applications spanning across multiple organ systems in the human body. State of the art in these technologies are described along with a discussion of current limitations and future opportunities.

N2  - Multifunctional particles with distinct physiochemical phases are required by a variety of applications in biomedical engineering, such as diagnostic imaging and targeted drug delivery. This motivates the development of a repeatable, efficient, and customizable approach to manufacturing particles with spatially segregated bioactive moieties. This study demonstrates a stereolithographic 3D printing approach for designing and fabricating large arrays of biphasic poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) gel particles. The fabrication parameters governing the physical and biochemical properties of multi-layered particles are thoroughly investigated, yielding a readily tunable approach to manufacturing customizable arrays of multifunctional particles. The advantage in spatially organizing functional epitopes is examined by loading superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) in separate layers of biphasic PEGDA gel particles and examining SPION-induced magnetic resonance (MR) contrast and BSA-release kinetics. Particles with spatial segregation of functional moieties have demonstrably higher MR contrast and BSA release. Overall, this study will contribute significant knowledge to the preparation of multifunctional particles for use as biomedical tools.

N2  - Over the past several years, biomaterials loaded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have increasingly been used to reduce the myocardial fate of postinfarction collagen deposition and scar tissue formation. Despite successful gains, therapeutic efficacy has remained limited because of restricted transport of cell-secreting factors at the site of implantation. We hypothesized that an MSC-laden hydrogel patch with multiple microchannels would retain transplanted cells on target tissue and support transport of cell-secreting factors into tissue. By doing so, the gel patch will improve the therapeutic potential of the cells and minimize the degradation of myocardial tissue postinfarction. To examine this hypothesis, a stereolithographic apparatus (SLA) was used to introduce microchannels of controlled diameters (e.g., 500 and 1000 μm) during in situ cross-linking reaction of poly(ethylene glycol)dimethacrylate solution suspended with cells. Placement of the MSC-laden, microchanneled gel patch on the occluded left coronary artery in a murine model showed significant improvement in the ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and stroke volume, compared with gel patches without MSCs and MSC-laden gel patches without microchannels. In particular, the microchannels significantly reduced the number of cells required to recover cardiac function, while minimizing cardiac remodeling. In sum, the microchanneled gel patch would provide a means to prevent abnormal fibrosis resulting from acute ischemic injury.

N2  - Understanding and controlling the interactions occurring between cells and engineered materials are central challenges toward progress in the development of biomedical devices. In this work, we describe materials for direct ink writing (DIW), an extrusion-based type of 3D printing, that embed a custom synthetic protein (RGD-PDL) within the microfilaments of 3D-hydrogel scaffolds to modify these interactions and differentially direct tissue-level organization of complex cell populations in vitro. The RGD-PDL is synthesized by modifying poly-d-lysine (PDL) to varying extents with peptides containing the integrin-binding motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Compositional gradients of the RGD-PDL presented by both patterned and thin-film poly(2-hydroxyethyl) methacrylate (pHEMA) substrates allow the patterning of cell-growth compliance in a grayscale form. The surface chemistry-dependent guidance of cell growth on the RGD-PDL-modified pHEMA materials is demonstrated using a model NIH-3T3 fibroblast cell line. The formation of a more complex cellular system - organotypic primary murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) - in culture is also achieved on these scaffolds, where distinctive forms of cell growth and migration guidance are seen depending on their RGD-PDL content and topography. This experimental platform for the study of physicochemical factors on the formation and the reorganization of organotypic cultures offers useful capabilities for studies in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and diagnostics.

N2  - Materials chemistries for hydrogel scaffolds that are capable of programming temporal (4D) attributes of cellular decision-making in supported 3D microcultures are described. The scaffolds are fabricated using direct-ink writing (DIW)—a 3D-printing technique using extrusion to pattern scaffolds at biologically relevant diameters (≤ 100 µm). Herein, DIW is exploited to variously incorporate a rheological nanoclay, Laponite XLG (LAP), into 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)-based hydrogels—printing the LAP–HEMA (LH) composites as functional modifiers within otherwise unmodified 2D and 3D HEMA microstructures. The nanoclay-modified domains, when tested as thin films, require no activating (e.g., protein) treatments to promote robust growth compliances that direct the spatial attachment of fibroblast (3T3) and preosteoblast (E1) cells, fostering for the latter a capacity to direct long-term osteodifferentiation. Cell-to-gel interfacial morphologies and cellular motility are analyzed with spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM). Through combination of HEMA and LH gels, high-resolution DIW of a nanocomposite ink (UniH) that translates organizationally dynamic attributes seen with 2D gels into dentition-mimetic 3D scaffolds is demonstrated. These analyses confirm that the underlying materials chemistry and geometry of hydrogel nanocomposites are capable of directing cellular attachment and temporal development within 3D microcultures—a useful material system for the 4D patterning of hydrogel scaffolds.

N2  - The use of cells in clinical therapies holds great promise for the treatment of a wide range of diseases and disorders. However, the fate of cells depends on several soluble and insoluble environmental factors. It is well known that bonds formed between cells and their surrounding environments can direct cellular activities, phenotypes, etc. Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to develop methods to characterize the engagement of integrins with adhesion ligands and their effects on cell adhesion, signaling activation, and phenotypic activities, both in vitro and in vivo. This chapter summarizes methods developed to quantitatively evaluate (1) cell adhesion forces and (2) the number of integrin-ligand bonds formed on two-dimensional (2D) and within 3D platforms, all of which can be examined with respect to cellular phenotypic properties and cellular fates.
AB  - The use of cells in clinical therapies holds great promise for the treatment of a wide range of diseases and disorders. However, the fate of cells depends on several soluble and insoluble environmental factors. It is well known that bonds formed between cells and their surrounding environments can direct cellular activities, phenotypes, etc. Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to develop methods to characterize the engagement of integrins with adhesion ligands and their effects on cell adhesion, signaling activation, and phenotypic activities, both in vitro and in vivo.
